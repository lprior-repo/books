# BETTER SOFTWARE FASTER DAVE FARLEY'S HOW TO GUIDE

#### What to Test, and When?

Continuous Delivery gets us fast and frequent feedback from our customers and our tests, to enable us to learn, make evidence-based decisions and improve our software.

Throughout the development process there are many opportunities to monitor, measure and evaluate our software, and lots of different types of tests.

At Commit - Development supporting tests. Fast, lightweight, technical tests which give developers fast feedback; and other checks that the code does what the developer expects it to, and that increase confidence in the code.

Acceptance – Defining Releasability. More user-centred tests to evaluate the code from the users' perspective, and everything else that we need to check to know that the software is sufficiently fast, scalable, secure, resilient and fulfils its purpose.

At Release - What we need to check at the point that we are ready to release the software into Production.

In Production – Once in Production, how do we understand how our software performs. What do our customers make of it? What can we learn that informs business or technical decisions. How can we continue to learn and enhance our products?

This guide provides a simple framework to support the development of a testing strategy:

How to choose what types of tests to do, and when.
