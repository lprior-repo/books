To my wonderful wife, who makes every endeavor possible and contributes to reviewing all the words written.

– Mark Peters

To my wife and son, whose unwavering support and daily inspiration have made every step of this journey possible. Your belief in me fuels my continuous growth and success.

– Gautham Pallapa

#### <span id="page-4-0"></span>Foreword

Even aer a decade of fullling work in the Platform Engineering space, the productivity magic of great platform teams continues to inspire me. Just recently, a customer delightfully shared how their developers cut timelines by 80% thanks to the unexpected ease of moving their applications to their rst deployment. What might have taken weeks of highly skilled human effort, made effortless by the convenience of a resilient, secure, and intuitive self-service interface.

During my ve years working with Gautham Pallapa, we helped ignite and extend Platform Engineering transformations across some of the world's largest enterprises. Our customers consistently relied on his thoughtful and analytical insights not just to make the initial decision to embark on their journey, but more importantly, to continually benchmark their progress against both their potential and their peers. Gautham's rare blend of technical depth, cultural awareness, and business acumen accelerated their progress at every stage. Now, readers have a remarkable opportunity to draw from that proven experience throughout this book.

As we enter the era of AI-enabled development and operations, the need for standardized platforms, patterns, and infrastructure is more critical than ever. Two signicant forces are driving this shi:

First, the time pressure to deliver AI-enabled features is once again highlighting soware engineering's core responsibility to deliver outcomes and value for the organization. Executive sponsors today have little patience for multi-year transformations, and nothing accelerates delivery like a well-designed platform.

Second, for all its breakthroughs, AI remains a probabilistic technology. Integrating and debugging AI-enabled capabilities will be far more manageable within the same simplied interfaces and standardized environments that already enhance human productivity.

If the benets of Platform Engineering are so clear and enduring, why haven't more organizations adopted it at scale? It's worth briey considering the alternative—the inverse of a proactive platform approach. In this text, you will nd a helpful summary of Platform Engineering:

e evolution of Platform Engineering is a narrative of adaptation and foresight.

Foresight is the primary barrier to adopting a platform-centric approach. Intuitively, we all understand that if we wait until we are already late for the airport, it's too late to build the highway to get there. e same principle applies to organizational design, tooling and automation scope, and consistent infrastructure architecture. For a platform approach to succeed, someone in every organization must possess and champion foresight across these domains.

Since you are picking up this important book to study Platform Engineering today, perhaps with a bit of passion, study, and persistence, that person will be you!

# <span id="page-34-5"></span><span id="page-34-0"></span>What is Platform Engineering?

<span id="page-34-4"></span>At the dynamic intersection of technology and customer demands, a powerful new paradigm has emerged that is fundamentally redening the contours of soware development and operations: Platform Engineering. is innovative discipline heralds a transformative shi, reimagining the digital landscape by enabling organizations to harness technology with precision, scalability, and efficiency.

<span id="page-34-3"></span><span id="page-34-2"></span><span id="page-34-1"></span>At its core, a platform is a cohesive set of digital tools and shared infrastructure designed to deliver value through repeatable and standardized processes. Platforms incorporate core components such as Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs), which provide developers with self-service tools for managing their workows; Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for consistent, declarative infrastructure management; and automated CI/CD pipelines, which enable secure soware supply chains and accelerate the delivery of high-quality applications.

Platform Engineering builds on these foundations by unifying developers and IT operations teams around a shared, standardized, and scalable infrastructure, ensuring faster and more reliable soware delivery. is discipline emphasizes automation, consistency, and self-service capabilities, reducing operational friction and empowering teams to focus on innovation rather than managing complexity.

Much like generative AI, which adapts and learns from vast datasets to deliver tailored, context-aware outputs, Platform Engineering thrives on iterative feedback and responsiveness. Both disciplines create environments that foster innovation, efficiency, and agility, enabling organizations to meet dynamic demands with precision and speed.

For instance, generative AI has been instrumental in revolutionizing personalized content creation, where it learns from vast datasets to generate tailored, context-aware recommendations for users. Similarly, Platform Engineering has been applied in the creation of scalable cloud platforms, evolving its systems, tooling, and processes to empower teams to meet shiing demands with precision and speed.

Like generative AI, which abstracts complexity to deliver intuitive solutions, Platform Engineering simplies intricate development workows, making it easier for teams to focus on innovation rather than operational hurdles. Both thrive on continuous feedback—generative AI renes outputs through iterative learning, while Platform Engineering actively seeks and utilizes ongoing feedback loops to optimize developer experiences and operational outcomes.

By lling gaps, easing transitions, and enhancing performance, Platform Engineering creates a synergistic relationship with DevOps, where their combined strengths amplify human creativity and productivity. In today's fast-paced digital landscape, this shared adaptability is critical. Just as generative AI quickly produces solutions tailored to specic challenges, Platform Engineering equips teams with the exibility to pivot and recalibrate strategies in response to technological and market changes, ensuring businesses remain resilient, relevant, and competitive.

Businesses worldwide are facing signicant challenges in keeping up with the fast-paced digital era. Platform Engineering, like generative AI, offers the ability to learn and adapt, which is crucial in such a hyper-dynamic environment. e exibility provided by Platform Engineering allows teams to quickly pivot and adjust their strategies in response to market demands and technological advancements, ensuring that they remain relevant and competitive.

is approach to creating and maintaining soware is based on a few fundamental principles, the most important of which is ensuring the platform is simple and easy to use. at simplicity is the key to unlocking the full potential of soware development. e real beauty of a platform lies not in how complex it is but in how well it meets the needs of the people who will be using it. Understanding and addressing these needs is at the heart of effective soware development. For example, a well-designed platform should demonstrate measurable improvements in developer productivity, reduce cycle times for delivering soware, improve deployment frequency, and maintain low mean time to recovery (MTTR)—clear indicators of its effectiveness in meeting user needs. Metrics such as platform adoption rates and developer satisfaction scores can also provide valuable insights into how well the platform serves its intended purpose.

<span id="page-35-0"></span>When choosing the right tools for the job, being selective is essential. Not every tool is suitable for every job, and having too many options can make it hard to choose the best one. Platform Engineering recommends carefully selecting a small number of tools that are well-suited to the task at hand and that align with the goals of the enterprise. is targeted approach ensures that the platform meets functional requirements while optimizing resource utilization, achieving operational excellence, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration.

e effective implementation of Platform Engineering calls for a culture that values feedback and emphasizes continuous improvement. is approach fosters a collaborative environment where developers have the necessary tools and workows to create and deploy applications that resonate with the users. However, it's essential to note that the success of these platforms is essentially dependent on proper utilization, regular updates, and openness to feedback.

Enterprises that adopt this approach can create an architecture that not only simplies the creation and maintenance of soware but also propels them forward on their digital journey. erefore,

organizations must understand that the tools they employ are only as effective as the individuals wielding them. By empowering developers to use these platforms to their fullest potential, businesses can achieve their goals and stay ahead of the competition.

By embracing DevOps, businesses can unlock noteworthy benets, including faster time-to-market, improved soware quality, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

Central to the success of DevOps is the CALMS model, which denes the core principles of DevOps as a combination of Culture, Automation, Lean practices, Measurement, and Sharing. is model emphasizes the importance of fostering a collaborative culture, automating repetitive tasks, optimizing workows through Lean principles, and using metrics to drive continuous improvement. Sharing knowledge and tools across teams creates a foundation of transparency and collective responsibility, ensuring that every part of the organization works toward common goals. e CALMS model has revolutionized the digital landscape by embedding these principles into the fabric of DevOps transformations, enabling businesses to adapt rapidly to changing demands.

In addition to CALMS, practices such as Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) serve as pillars of DevOps. CI enables developers to frequently integrate their code into a shared repository, where automated testing ensures quality at every step. CD extends this automation, seamlessly deploying changes to production environments, reducing human error, and ensuring a faster time-to-market. Further enhancing the DevOps toolset, IaC has revolutionized conguration management by treating infrastructure as programmable code, fostering consistency, scalability, and repeatability across environments.

ese practices, combined with the CALMS principles, epitomize DevOps's technical and cultural excellence, fundamentally reshaping how soware is developed and delivered. Together, they have created a framework that accelerates innovation, enhances collaboration, and drives measurable business value, setting the stage for Platform Engineering as the next evolutionary step in this transformative journey.

# <span id="page-37-2"></span><span id="page-37-0"></span>History of DevOps – A cultural and technological renaissance

<span id="page-37-1"></span>DevOps emerged as a result of the pressing need for greater collaboration, incremental progress, and adaptability in the operational aspects of soware development. Despite the success of the Agile soware development movement, a disconnect persisted between creation and implementation, leading to inefficiency and delays. e term DevOps was coined by Patrick Debois, an IT consultant

from Belgium, during the rst DevOpsDays conference in 2009. is event served as a catalyst for a global renaissance in the IT industry by promoting a culture where collaboration is paramount and silos are dismantled. DevOps sought to create an environment where soware building, testing, and release could occur rapidly, frequently, and reliably. By bringing developers (Dev) and IT operators (Ops) together under a unied philosophy—and, importantly, within the same team— DevOps aimed to foster a culture of continuous delivery, innovation, and reliability. e signicance of DevOps lies in its ability to bridge the gap between developers and IT operations, paving the way for organizations to realize their full potential.

Beyond its cultural impact, DevOps has profoundly shaped modern technological architecture. e movement's emphasis on rapid, iterative delivery paved the way for adopting microservices architecture, enabling teams to develop and deploy modular components of applications independently. Complementing this is the rise of containerization technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, which ensure consistent deployment across environments and streamline the scalability of cloud-native systems. ese innovations illustrate how DevOps has reshaped workows and redened how soware systems are designed and operated.

e principles of Agile soware development profoundly inuenced the foundations of DevOps. Agile introduced the idea of iterative progress and cross-functional collaboration, which DevOps expanded into the operational domain. is interplay between Agile and DevOps would lay the groundwork for transforming how organizations approach the entire soware development life cycle.

# <span id="page-38-4"></span><span id="page-38-0"></span>The Agile Manifesto

<span id="page-38-3"></span><span id="page-38-2"></span><span id="page-38-1"></span>e inception of DevOps dates back to the early 2000s, when the Agile Manifesto sought to transform traditional soware development practices. Initially, Agile practices became the norm, but the operational aspect of soware development needed to catch up, leading to a signicant disparity in business value delivery. While developers enjoyed newfound exibility, operators still used outdated methodologies that were incompatible with the Agile ethos. Most critically, operations teams oen lacked visibility into how their efforts contributed to overarching business goals, resulting in a misalignment between operational execution and the strategic value businesses sought to deliver. is caused a misalignment between what was built and what the business needed. is growing gap underscored the urgent need for a more cohesive and comprehensive approach to soware life cycle management.

Agile frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban were pivotal in shaping early soware development practices, emphasizing adaptability and the power of team collaboration. Scrum introduced structured processes such as sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives, enabling teams to plan and deliver work in manageable increments iteratively. Kanban complemented this by providing a visual approach to managing workows, promoting continuous delivery, and reducing bottlenecks through work-in-progress limits. ese frameworks empowered development teams to respond swily to changing priorities and deliver value incrementally, highlighting the power of teamwork in soware development.

However, while Agile revolutionized development practices, it initially failed to address the operational aspects of IT. Now procient at delivering frequent releases, development teams oen handed off their work to operations teams still bound by traditional, rigid processes. As you can imagine, the increased frequency of deployments overwhelmed the operations teams signicantly, as they were not equipped to handle such rapid change. is disparity in velocity created bottlenecks and misalignment, as operations teams became the gatekeepers of stability while developers pushed for continuous innovation.

e need for a unied approach to soware development and operations became increasingly apparent. is dynamic of clashing priorities highlighted the importance of bridging the divide between developers and operators, fostering collaboration, and establishing workows that could seamlessly integrate both domains. e challenges of this disconnect catalyzed the emergence of DevOps, a transformative approach that would bridge these gaps, redene soware life cycle management, and set the stage for a new era of efficiency and alignment.

# <span id="page-39-2"></span><span id="page-39-0"></span>Bridging the divide – The birth of DevOps

<span id="page-39-1"></span>e divide between development and operations teams highlighted critical inefficiency that Agile practices alone could not resolve. While Agile empowered developers to iterate rapidly and deliver frequent updates, operations teams oen grappled with systems that were unprepared for such rapid changes. is misalignment and a lack of shared goals created bottlenecks, delayed releases, and undermined the ability to deliver consistent customer value. Addressing these challenges required a transformative approach that unied development and operations into a cohesive and collaborative workow.

DevOps emerged as this transformative solution, bridging the gap by aligning development and operations under shared objectives. At its core, DevOps represents a cultural shi that fosters collaboration, empathy, and shared accountability, enabling cross-functional teams to own the soware delivery life cycle collectively. is unied philosophy eliminated silos and redened workows, empowering teams to deliver high-quality soware rapidly and reliably while maintaining system stability.

Beyond culture, DevOps introduced a new focus on measurable performance improvements through key metrics. Deployment frequency became a central indicator of agility, reecting how quickly teams could deliver code to production. MTTR highlighted operational resilience, measuring the time required to restore service aer an incident. ese metrics provided organizations with tangible benchmarks to assess and rene their DevOps practices, ensuring alignment between technical performance and business outcomes.

e rst DevOpsDays conference, held in 2009 and spearheaded by Patrick Debois, marked a pivotal moment in shaping the DevOps movement. It brought together practitioners to share ideas, tools, and experiences, fostering a sense of community and catalyzing the adoption of DevOps principles. At the heart of this philosophy lies the principle of "fail fast, learn quickly," which reframes failure as an opportunity for growth. By embedding practices such as automated testing, CI, and proactive monitoring, DevOps empowers teams to identify and resolve issues early, minimizing disruption and accelerating delivery cycles.

DevOps is more than a set of practices; it is a mindset that transforms how teams approach soware development and operations. By combining cultural change with automation and measurable success, DevOps has become a critical enabler of agility, scalability, and innovation in modern soware delivery. As organizations continue to navigate the complexities of digital transformation, DevOps serves as a vital framework for driving operational excellence and achieving business goals.

Terraform, with its declarative language, excels in multi-cloud environments, whereas AWS CloudFormation is oen the go-to choice for AWS-specic resources. ese tools differ in syntax, cloud service provider focus, and the extent to which they manage state—critical factors in their selection. IaC is pivotal in enabling scalable and reproducible environments. However, managing security is equally essential; best practices include using secure secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in IaC les and ensuring access to infrastructure is properly restricted to authorized entities. Adopting these practices aligns IaC workows with DevOps security standards, mitigating risks while maintaining agility.

Chef and Puppet, while more complex, offer a more mature solution with a stronger emphasis on state and the idempotency of system conguration. e decision to use one of these tools over the others oen comes down to the team's expertise, the need for scalability, and the complexity of the infrastructure.
- <span id="page-52-15"></span><span id="page-52-8"></span><span id="page-52-2"></span>Container orchestration systems: Kubernetes (or K8s) has emerged as the de facto standard for container orchestration due to its robust scaling and self-healing capabilities. Every hyperscaler and cloud virtualization company has its own avor of Kubernetes. Alternatives such as Docker Swarm and Apache Mesos present simpler, albeit less feature-rich, options. e choice among these technologies will typically be inuenced by the organization's scalability needs, the existing container ecosystem, and the required level of control over container orchestration.
- <span id="page-52-16"></span><span id="page-52-9"></span>Monitoring and logging: Effective monitoring and logging are crucial for maintaining visibility into applications and infrastructure. Prometheus provides powerful monitoring capabilities and works particularly well with Kubernetes, while the Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stack offers comprehensive logging solutions that excel in data visualization and analysis. Selecting between these options oen involves considering the ease of setup, the scalability of the solution, and integration with existing systems.

is analysis does not prescribe a one-size-ts-all solution but rather emphasizes the importance of aligning technological choices with organizational needs, goals, and capabilities. It's a delicate balance that requires a strategic vision aligned with practical execution capabilities. e right mix of technologies can empower Platform Engineering and DevOps practices, driving efficiency, innovation, and resilience. In Platform Engineering and DevOps, every technology is a vital component in a well-oiled machine. It's not just about individual strengths but how they come together to form a cohesive and efficient platform. Optimal technology combinations can produce greater results, leading to improved operational efficiency and increased innovation.

Everything in soware ascribes to specic standards, from security to operations, and running a platform is no different. Platforms use shared digital tools with a common infrastructure to maximize value. Understanding the standards applied to a platform starts with the essential cloud migration; the cloud format selected from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, or Google; and then moves from the cloud structure into setting up clusters for Kubernetes. e basic standards allow us to design and implement custom architectures within those spaces, but architectures also have their own standards. e chapter explains how to set up a platform within a cloud with a practical, custom architecture, leading to success and meeting regulatory standards.

An analogy for building a good platform is asking someone else to build your workshop rather than doing it yourself. You need to build a shelf, so you travel to the hardware store and buy wood, tools, and screws. On returning home, you realize that you have forgotten something and return to the store. e project multiplies, taking more time and effort than you want to spend. e process requires grabbing multiple items, at different times, as the need arises. When building architecture, you plan what you need in the workshop so that the tools are available and safe, and you can complete projects without returning to the hardware store. e successful platform provides everything up front, without you ever needing to return to a marketplace, and keeps all the tools up to date. e architectural concepts in this chapter provide some options for designing the best platform to accomplish user needs, scaling to multiple projects, and eventually including multiple platforms.

In this chapter, we'll introduce key architectural concepts that form the foundation of modern platforms. We'll break down architecture into specic components to guide practical implementation, and examine how to scale and secure these models to ensure greater resilience. e chapter also explores the challenges that arise when balancing legacy systems with cloud-native applications, and concludes by outlining various architectural models that apply across different elements of a platform.

We will be covering the following main topics:

- Core concepts and components
- Designing for scalability, security, and resilience
- From legacy systems to cloud-native applications

## <span id="page-55-4"></span><span id="page-55-2"></span>Technical requirements

ere are no technical requirements for this section. A minimal understanding of architectural diagrams and some basic Terraform knowledge could prove helpful.

## <span id="page-56-5"></span><span id="page-56-0"></span>Core concepts and components

At the beginning of an architectural design, it can help to start with a common framework. Regardless of where you build architecture, any cloud-based strategy incorporates four primary areas:

- <span id="page-56-1"></span>Cloud: e cloud is the basic framework for later operations, a space where the potential exists for events to occur, such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or a private cloud installation. Many take the cloud to mean that operations occur somewhere else, which is also valid. When you run private constructions, the virtual space is the cloud, just a private one on a personal server. e cloud contains all the requirements and standards to operate on someone else's server. e following three components are all contained within the initial cloud.
- <span id="page-56-2"></span>Cluster: Clusters aggregate a collection of virtual machines that can work together to accomplish tasks. Clusters typically use a standard function such as a controller node to integrate the various tasks. Controller nodes manage tasks in a cluster to effectively determine compute and storage for various functions. Kubernetes and Docker are examples of shared services used to integrate clusters. Clusters are designed to act like a single system delivering parallel processing, high levels of availability, and balanced resources across a wide function base.
- <span id="page-56-4"></span>Container: Containers are the next level down within the cluster. Each container, or group of containers, can operate independently or dependently with other containers in the cluster. Containers should be packaged programs that execute all the dependencies within a single instance. Another term for a container is a unit of capability.
- <span id="page-56-3"></span>Code: e last level is code. Code describes the language used to provide instructions to the computer. Containers are written in code and then executed.

ese areas are demonstrated in the following gure:

![](_page_57_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 2.1: The four Cs of cloud computing

Multiple containers operate within a cluster, and multiple clusters can interact within the cloud. When designing a platform, the rst architectural choice is picking a cloud. Since platform design optimizes streamlined functions, multi-cloud functionality can remain an issue. Within the cloud, platforms can operate multiple clusters and design them based on functionality. As a reminder, a platform is a set of digital tools using a shared infrastructure to create value. A good example is having a collaboration function within a cluster that interacts with other clusters designed for development, testing, and production. Separating clusters allows multiple functions to happen simultaneously. Each cluster will incorporate multiple containers to run specic functions like development environments, version control, security testing, or user management.

<span id="page-57-0"></span>e Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model for data interaction is another option to consider when designing a platform. Understanding what each tool requires within the platform allows structuring interaction to maximize value. e mnemonic for remembering these layers is All People Seem To Need Data Processing, standing for Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data link, and Physical. When looking at the initial architecture for a platform, we are mainly concerned with the middle three layers (Session, Transport, and Network). We assume that Physical (raw data) and Data link (data format) are handled by the initial cloud. Our primary objective is to assess the network; move data within the system; transmission; review communication between clusters, containers, and sessions; and maintain working connections and ports within the platform. Presentation and Application are important but remain on the outside as the nal interface of presenting usable data to the user in a format that allows simple interactions. ese foundational considerations are oen reected in common architectural patterns, which provide a baseline for understanding how systems interact. Building on that, the chapter then introduces more specialized platform architectures that address the unique demands of modern, scalable environments.

A common architecture should provide guidelines to expand. e typical architectural guidelines are the SOLID principles. ese principles are important as we build a platform architecture:

- <span id="page-58-7"></span><span id="page-58-2"></span>Single responsibility: Each architectural object has only one reason to change.
- <span id="page-58-6"></span>Open-closed: Every element is open for extension and closed for modication.
- <span id="page-58-5"></span>Liskov substitution: All class elements can be derived from a parent class and will still provide the same results.
- <span id="page-58-4"></span>Interface segregation: Users should not depend on unused interfaces.
- <span id="page-58-3"></span>Dependency inversion: Objects should depend on abstractions rather than inversion.

ese principles have guided much of the transition between monolithic systems and the microservices approach, but they remain an important guideline. Numerous research and materials appear across the internet on each principle and their combined effectiveness, but that is beyond the scope of this book; hopefully, the generic reference will either spark your brain or guide you to the necessary information.

#### <span id="page-58-8"></span><span id="page-58-0"></span>The essential platform

<span id="page-58-1"></span>When examining the principles in aggregate, they show important factors desired in a platform. A platform should support various applications, and when the SOLID foundation governs their interaction, it helps to create a resilient architecture.

When converting to a platform, we change our mindset from building an entire system to a partial one that enables the broader design to function. ere are two important aspects to rst consider within the platform architecture:

- How to design it
- Where to display or implement those designs

ese aspects can be best dened as collaborative and deployment components. A collaborative environment generally uses a common cluster with multiple containers to provide functions. e deployment target will also be a cluster with a different set of containers depending on the purpose of that deployment target. Both can be scaled repeatedly to add resilience and expand operations, but discussing each in detail provides a starting point for a broader architecture.

<span id="page-59-1"></span>e collaboration component is the rst element to consider in architectural design for a platform. When we say collaboration, we mean the spot where cooperative work can happen. is work includes all elements short of the actual deployment of the application. From the DevOps perspective, these are the elements to plan, code, and build. Monitoring applications can also collaborate as they gather information from the deployment targets. e most essential part of any collaboration occurs in the discussion between the team and establishing a communication function. Essential support for this should include some asynchronous chat, such as Mattermost or Slack. ese communication tools provide a way for the individual team and multiple teams to connect.

<span id="page-59-3"></span><span id="page-59-0"></span>e second element of collaboration is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). While an IDE could be as basic as a text editor or VSCode, you could provide options such as GitHub, GitLab, or Anaconda, depending on the later platform demands. Different IDEs specialize in different languages and enable platform customization even if plug-in soware can make an IDE multi-language. One essential is that the connection chosen should be linked to the communication piece so that IDE commits and changes are visible to the broader team. IDEs should also include common security aspects such as fuzz testing, static analysis, linting, and dependency checks. Including these security aspects as a separate platform element is possible but most effective when directly tied to code.

<span id="page-59-5"></span><span id="page-59-4"></span>Communication components and the IDE link to the third element of collaboration, work management. Some IDEs provide ways to track work as an embedded feature, but using an external tool such as the Atlassian suite or Aha can be benecial. ese tools allow high-level observability into elements through feature ags, essential tasks, and connections to releases. In addition, these work management tools should also provide knowledge management for the platform. Knowledge management includes various how-to guides and self-help pieces. Linking work and knowledge management provides a place for generative AI to excel, nding not only standard documentation but internal instances across chat, planning, and work execution. As an example, when searching for information about App A, you would nd the how-to documentation, mentions in Slack, and tasks on a Jira board. ese could be cross-referenced or time-linked to provide context.

<span id="page-59-2"></span>Monitoring elements are a good addition to the collaborative environment but are not required. Monitoring means linking some operational tools to demonstrate which users are present and active, how the various deployment targets are running, current updates, and various other data. ese tools link through functions and soware such as Prometheus, Kibana, Grafana, Open Telemetry, and the Elastic Stack. ese tools should provide those using the platform with observability.

<span id="page-60-2"></span><span id="page-60-1"></span>All these collaborative elements are centrally managed by an integrated dashboard. is dashboard allows you to manage users within the platform, observe operational metrics, and manage permissions. e permissions element should integrate through a Single-Sign-On (SSO) application once a user establishes an identity. ese pieces also provide separation between multiple teams to establish security. is application ensures that teams within the platform can only access approved data. Sometimes, you want all the platform teams to view everything, and sometimes, regulatory or compliance standards might require separation in either the coding or the data used in the deployment targets. With all those elements in mind, the following diagram gives an example of the collaborative architecture within the platform:

![](_page_60_Figure_2.jpeg)

<span id="page-60-0"></span>Figure 2.2: Collaboration components diagram

Each functional element is depicted as a single container, but they can be multiple containers or applications depending on the functional needs. For example, work management can include timekeeping, program progress, and business-level reporting, while an IDE might include security tools or alternate languages. Communication can also include knowledge repositories.

Monitoring responsibilities are shared between these tools throughout the collaboration element. Monitoring occurs for multiple reasons but should benet observability through operational and developmental aspects. At the application level, systems can incorporate tools such as Prometheus, Open Telemetry (O-TEL) or the ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK) stack to provide adequate

<span id="page-61-4"></span>visibility. Cloud integration can also use tools such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or Datadog to combine the various pieces. Monitoring should provide details on which applications are being used, at what level, and how the platform performs during their usage.

## <span id="page-61-5"></span><span id="page-61-0"></span>Deployment components

<span id="page-61-3"></span>Deployment components are those virtual spaces where you deploy code from the platform. ese targets support the DevOps functions for testing, releasing, and deployment. Much like the initial element, these clusters are built from Infrastructure as Code with clear requirement denitions. Although these work functions follow the collaboration cluster, SSO should be enabled to allow direct, secure access to these clusters. Denitions provide a safe space to work. Common denitions include Kubernetes baselines, Docker congurations, Amazon Machine Interfaces, or specic Linux releases. Returning to the concept of the workshop metaphor, the deployment environment functions as a controlled space where teams can safely test and release their work. It offers the stability and isolation needed to validate changes before they move further down the delivery pipeline, reinforcing the platform's reliability and reducing risk during deployment.

<span id="page-61-2"></span><span id="page-61-1"></span>Deployment cluster creation, which occurs through implementing a common baseline, typically includes two functions residing solely in that environment: the continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) functions. CI/CD tools are the elements of the platform that test and publish soware. Remember, the building piece appeared as a part of the collaboration environment. ese tools communicate with that IDE to pull new code changes or receive pushes from the underlying platform. Some DevOps professionals see the initial pipeline as the nal integration of CI; as we build common platforms, the pipelines we use in the platform are only the rst step. Examples of commercially available CI tools include Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD, and Harness. I prefer GitLab CI/CD as it integrates smoothly with the GitLab IDE incorporated in the collaboration environment. e deployment environment architecture is shown in Figure 2.3:

![](_page_62_Figure_0.jpeg)

<span id="page-62-0"></span>Figure 2.3: Deployment environment

Builders oen select multiple tools to prevent vendor lock-in. Vendor lock-in can be difficult, but many of the GitLab functions are smooth enough to allow easy export between tools. Recently, one well-known vendor migrated from open source to a subscription model, requiring anyone using the model to pay license fees. At the same time, switching vendors frequently across the platform can lead to integration issues and is one reason why self-built platforms take such a long time to achieve protability. e Platform Engineering goal is to build a common platform for various developers. Azure DevOps excels in allowing deployment to multiple environments regardless of where the code is built, or where pipelines are executed.

e CI tool ensures all new and approved code changes integrate into the new code. is integration provides productized version control in the applications available to the customer. e versions in the following sentences are generic and not connected to any particular tool. In the background, within the collaboration environment, you may be working on versions 7.16, 7.17, and 8, but the version released to the customer and supported might only be 7.15. is is because 7.15 is the full production version that has been tested and deployed. An effective CI tool in a Kubernetes implementation would allow the creation of distinct namespaces for each version to ensure the quality of changes.

e next step implements CD tools to expose the desired version, in this case, version 7.15 to the customer. e current version may have bug xes or security concerns that do not require a new release. ese implementations occur through CD. CD automatically readies submitted code for release into the production environment. ese tools ensure those changes reach the customer immediately every time updates to the baseline code occurs. Standard tools specializing in CD include Jenkins, GitLab, Datadog, GoCD, and JBoss. ArgoCD and FluxCD are tools for the delivery of Kubernetes solutions.

In many cases, nding a tool delivering exclusively CI or CD can be challenging because many companies prefer to integrate CI and CD. ese solutions work in broader applications but can create difficulty across a platform. In the platform, separating CI and CD functions creates the opportunity to work on multiple versions and features without slowing the development process. e decision to combine CI and CD in a single tool or split that functionality should be deliberate and based on resources, training, and cloud availability. DevOps methods frequently include CI and CD but cannot scale effectively beyond a single product or feature. Examples might include strictly controlled industries that require external testing, such as pharmaceuticals, or large companies with multiple legacy systems. Integration works well for a single team working on a single product or multiple teams working on different projects but proves challenging when you build to multiple teams supporting different aspects of a single project. e next section examines these challenges through the context of scalability, resilience, and security.

## <span id="page-63-2"></span><span id="page-63-0"></span>Designing for scalability, security, and resilience

<span id="page-63-1"></span>Now that you understand the essential platform components, we can discuss how these items can adjust for scalability, security, and resilience. Scalability relates to how we can add users and platforms without changing the architecture. Security ensures that only the individuals who intend to use the platform are still beneting from applications. Finally, platforms should demonstrate the resilience of the SOLID principles in allowing recovery while eliminating waste regarding unused cloud resources. ese aspects should be essential drivers of initially architecting a platform. One thought framework I use in applying new systems is shown in Figure 2.4:

![](_page_64_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 2.4: Thought framework

e framework appears as a table with operational elements down the middle and thought pillars around the side. Scalability and security are dened, while resilience forms the stable and adaptive pillars. e size of each operational element gives general trends for how much time users spend in those spaces. For example, teams should routinely spend three times as much work on development as design and four to ve times as much work on operations as deployment. Following sound DevOps principles, all of these functions should be automated as much as possible.

#### <span id="page-64-2"></span><span id="page-64-0"></span>Building for scalability

<span id="page-64-1"></span>We can dene scalability as the ability for the platform to continue to function well when it is changed in size or volume to meet customer needs. Typically, scalability applies upward to increased demands, but you can also think about downward trends when a function needs to contract. is scalability becomes especially relevant when considering a platform with a variable user base. You need to rapidly change to maximize high user numbers but implement auto-scaling to reduce cloud costs during off-hours or slow development periods.

Upwards scalability creates a more straightforward progression; you simply need more storage, compute, and functions. Functions such as databases, message queues, and analysis can complicate these progressions as well. Platform models support scalability as deployment clusters are eminently scalable. You can always add more clusters within the cloud to support additional app development. Internally, using Kubernetes namespaces allows the division between different applications, but conguration through resources such as Terraform makes life extremely easy. Generative AI support to provide coding elements can apply to any of these sections to supplement initial coding and solutions. If you have a Terraform basis for the deployment cluster, creating additional clusters is as easy as the following EKS sample:

```
Module "eks" {
  Source = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  Cluster_name = "deployment-target1"
  Subnets = ["subnet-1", "subnet-2"]
  vpc_id = "vpc-54321"
 workers_desired_capacity = 10
Instance_type = "t2.large"
}
```

e next step is running command lines for terraform init and applying and conguring kubectl with AWS to react to the individual cluster:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

is initializes the Terraform instance within the environment so that tools can be used and the variables are assessed. It then applies the variables to the Terraform code and ensures all elds are supportable. If an error occurs in apply, it will mean the variables are not clear in the supporting eld. e Terraform instance running those clusters will congure those instances with the previously referenced CI/CD functions for the deployment clusters.

Scalability for the collaboration cluster can be more difficult. In this case, the containers can scale by creating additional containers or changing CPU/memory limits rather than creating additional collaboration instances. If you add additional collaboration clusters, the challenge can be synching work across IDE, SSO, and work management instances. Many of those instances are designed to work separately. Integration becomes the prime challenge when multiple collaboration clusters are added with the same users. However, most of the referenced tools for those areas are designed to scale rapidly without changes.

<span id="page-65-0"></span>e primary guideline for scaling should be that one collaboration cluster can support any number of deployment targets. Collaboration clusters should only be added when a security or user-based challenge exists. User-based challenge means that I may employ different contractors and do not want them to be able to observe code from the other teams. As a side note, these logical separation types can be just as easily scaled and managed through the SSO functions. In those SSO functions, you can create different permissions and, using RBAC, prevent certain users from interacting with certain

elements or data within the collaboration node. ese considerations lead to building security functions as an integrated part of the platform architecture.

## <span id="page-66-6"></span><span id="page-66-0"></span>Designing security

<span id="page-66-5"></span><span id="page-66-3"></span>Security should be a primary feature of any platform design. Using SSO has been a continuing concept. SSO implements a session and user authentication service to allow users to use one set of credentials for multiple applications. While initial user credentials are frequently a username and password, modern designs should incorporate a One-time Personal Identication Number (OTP). OTP functions send a time-limited number to an external device to enter in conjunction with the username and password. Aer initial access, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides a viable alternative. is standard meets the security theory that verication emerges from something possessed, something known, and something intrinsic to the user, such as biometrics. All platform credentials should be stored in an encrypted account.

<span id="page-66-4"></span><span id="page-66-2"></span>For commercial platforms, one SSO example is to implement Open Authorization (OAuth) as a framework to federate user information between third-party services. Google uses this approach, as a single Google account can be activated with multiple applications and sites. However, other site information is maintained internally rather than externally available when integrating with the platform. A common example is to use Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for the platform, which then shares authentication across all the tools. is implementation allows designing the platform so a user can either log in to a central collaboration point, or directly to the applications within the platform.

<span id="page-66-1"></span>If you are integrating an existing SSO system rather than building one, some commercially available applications include Duo, Okta, AWS SSO, AuthPoint SSO, and Azure Active Directory. SSO is an area where beneting from someone else's extensive security knowledge can be helpful. Some SSO functions might be limited to a certain type of cloud. Understanding the cloud limitations in communicating security is essential to the initial platform architecture.

Once users are signed in, there is another element to consider within the platform: how do we protect the data? To create integration, data must be available within multiple applications, but you should still retain some control over the various functions. Data is typically categorized as data at rest and data in transit. In either case, some type of encryption can be benecial. You should encrypt access information, passwords, and usernames, with those functions being normally integrated within a good SSO system.

e other piece is that the data at rest, the code, and the work management details within the system should also be encrypted. One advantage to the platform is the majority of the work occurs within a

single cluster. is cluster-based approach is an advantage because internal data can remain unencrypted until accessed from the outside. is may be slightly misleading since most internal data would reside in encryption layers, just not encrypted between users within the same key structure. is encryption model improves communication speeds and prevents delays. For example, all the data used during the day would be unencrypted aer the user signed in but inaccessible without an approved sign-in. Aer operations, data would be backed up and stored in encrypted les. When users start the following day, they log in and continue to work as before, but any restoration would use the encrypted les. Security practices supplement backup and disaster recovery but ultimately demonstrate resilience within platforms.

## <span id="page-67-3"></span><span id="page-67-2"></span><span id="page-67-0"></span>Implementing resilience

<span id="page-67-1"></span>e rst example of resilience within the platform should be that an SSO links to a collaboration environment which, during the rst sign-on, creates a working place within all the subsequent applications. With a quick return to Figure 2.2, the operations would be an initial sign-in asking a user for a name, password, OTP, and then linking the user to an organization and a team. e user account would then be approved to work within the platform's communication, IDE, work management, and deployment applications. A quick example is as follows:

- User John Smith
- Password XXXXXX
- OTP Authenticator six-digit time-limited number
- Organization Ostrich
- Team Egg1
- Applications IDE, Communication, Work Management, CI

When the information is entered, John Smith would set up an OTP authenticator to verify access. e system would register him against the Ostrich organization and the Egg1 team for the IDE, communication window, work management tools, and CI. is system would ensure he can access team items in those areas. Additional areas might include roles that provide different sets of permissions within environments, as sometimes IDE systems distinguish between a guest who can view, a maintainer who can edit and create new work, and an owner who can merge work. e architecture should carefully detail each of these areas.

Building resilience between the platforms means laying out what each platform application requires and demonstrating parity between roles. For example, the role in the work management system might be a scrum master or team lead while the IDE role could be development lead or technical review. Understanding the limitations of those various pieces is critical for creating resilience when moving

from one application to the next. e more understanding there is between those roles, the better the applications interact within the platform. e best solution would be the same roles across all applications, but that can be difficult with commercially available functions.

<span id="page-68-4"></span><span id="page-68-3"></span>A critical aspect of resilience should be recovery. is recovery may be required because of a user error, a network outage, or a disaster such as a tornado or tsunami. Recovery involves having ready backups that can be quickly restored to provide functionality to the platform. Any resilient platform should conduct regular backups of the primary platform clusters and the data associated with those clusters. We must realize that there is a disconnect in operational performance between how you revert from an IDE upgrade, moving version 6.2 back to 6.1 to resolve a bug, and then how you restore data to that instantiation that users have committed. Versions are examples and do not reference any specic tool. ese aspects towards to standard recovery practices that the platform must support.

<span id="page-68-5"></span>A general backup process is the three-two-one model. Data storage should always occur in three locations, on two different media storage types, and with one copy offsite. is practice allows multiple places to verify crown-jewel data versus daily operations. An interesting real-world example is the NotPetya cyberattack against a signicant international shipper. When they commenced restoration, the shipper had lost hundreds of systems and realized all their backup systems were also infected. Only one site for the company had safe data to conduct any recovery operations, and that was because they were offline for maintenance when the attack happened. You should avoid this scenario at all costs, hence the three-two-one model for generating resilience in any system, especially the platform in our use case.

Scalability, resilience incorporated with adaptability and stability, and security should all form the basis for expanding into platform architecture. ese guidelines help shape those initial questions to build a comprehensive diagram. e next step is to agglomerate this conceptual understanding into a practical architecture to build or incorporate a platform within an organization.

## <span id="page-68-6"></span><span id="page-68-0"></span>From legacy systems to cloud-native applications

<span id="page-68-2"></span><span id="page-68-1"></span>ere are two main aspects to building a platform. e rst considers whether you are using cloudnative systems, and the second provides ways to build the various deployment targets into an architecture. Cloud-native operations will be discussed briey by reviewing the six Rs. e second half of this section explains how to design a permanent, transitory, or ephemeral design to support platform operations.

Any movement onto the cloud, or within clouds, depends on understanding the six Rs. As an experienced development professional, you should have already encountered many of them, although the full list is oen new to many architects. A list is included here, and each R will be discussed in more detail:

- <span id="page-69-8"></span><span id="page-69-3"></span>Rehost: Rehosting is sometimes called the li and shi approach. It involves taking a full current environment and moving it to a similar location, except on the cloud. is can be a quick migration but oen requires modications to achieve cost-effectiveness or stability. While this can help with the basics of platforming, the amount of integration required means other strategies will also be needed. is strategy applies to organizations that simply want to be on the cloud without understanding the implications. Implications may include increased latency, suboptimal resource usage, and generally poor performance.
- <span id="page-69-4"></span>Replatform: As a basic concept, re-platforming means adjusting to the cloud by integrating current processes with those provided by the cloud. As mentioned in this book, Platform Engineering takes a deeper look and assesses different types of platforms to cross-cut across multiple outputs. One DevOps concept involves using the thinnest possible platform for each section. is means that while platforms incorporate multiple technologies, they should build on stacks that potentially incorporate separate platforms. e primary platform assesses soware development, but this can be platformed multiple times to integrate with platforms for operational output, security, testing, or other functions. Each platform should support those minimal functions to remain reliable and secure and help with scalability.
- <span id="page-69-10"></span><span id="page-69-5"></span>Repurchase: e third alternative is repurchasing, buying another cloud alternative, or moving from local servers to someone else's server. is enforces what can be called the three As of migration:
  - Access: Having wider access to systems through cloud services.
  - Awareness: Being more broadly aware of everything occurring within a space due to cloud tools, and VM interaction.
  - Abdication: Abandoning all responsibility for elements within your platform by depending on cloud services to perform those functions.

<span id="page-69-11"></span><span id="page-69-9"></span><span id="page-69-6"></span><span id="page-69-1"></span>Repurchasing typically occurs when users want to gain access and awareness but want to abdicate management responsibilities.

- Retain: is is the opposite to the repurchase option; here, we keep what we have. Retaining practices can benet the lower end but creates challenges when scaling platforms, mainly because the additional resources are not readily available. It is a different order of complexity between merely purchasing additional storage and computing through a credit card swipe and installing new server racks.
- <span id="page-69-7"></span>Retire: Retiring means eliminating some of the services that are no longer needed. It also integrates with the next option.
- <span id="page-69-2"></span>Refactor: is means redesigning and rebuilding needed functions. is can be used as a means to enhance performance through scalability and security changes. One common example of refactoring involves moving from legacy to more modern applications, which oen involves containerizing soware and applications.

Platform Engineering solves both challenges by focusing on what elements are needed for a particular platform, bringing them into a common framework, and eliminating waste within the process. Refactoring can be critical when building a platform but less so when buying or renting solutions. Most commercial platform solutions offer various available plugins supporting a constant soware stream.

## <span id="page-69-12"></span><span id="page-69-0"></span>Essential platform architecture

<span id="page-70-2"></span><span id="page-70-0"></span>Aer considering the six Rs, and the motivation for an initial cloud transition, the next step is designing a platform architecture. is architecture will inform subsequent design by creating a workshop with space to expand and having all the available tools within easy reach. ere are three basic designs to begin or continue a platform design, each focusing on developing the thinnest possible platform and supporting the widest customer base. e difference between the designs lies largely in the permanence of the proposed design. e three designs can be labeled simply as follows:

- Permanent
- Transitory
- Ephemeral

e following gure demonstrates the construction of these three initial architectural models:

![](_page_70_Figure_5.jpeg)

<span id="page-70-3"></span><span id="page-70-1"></span>Figure 2.5: Platform architecture samples

Let's look at these architectures in more detail.

#### Permanent platform architecture

Permanent architecture is designed for the long term. e goal is to design and operate multiple clusters that are always there for the user. e system probably incorporates a primary collaboration cluster, at least one development cluster, and a production cluster. When designing a permanent approach, users would log in to the collaboration cluster and then promote work and design through the other clusters. is approach provides a highly stable environment for testing and deploying code. A permanent design deprecates load balancers on the primary tools by using pre-determined cluster sizes within the VPCs. Operational management allows us to add clusters if computing or storage

becomes a concern. e primary advantage of this architecture is known conguration and easy maintenance. Establishing set clusters with dened namespaces early in the process creates an opportunity for set training approaches. ese designs use pre-determined locations and known clusters for all operations. Companies with well-dened soware needs or static concerns might prefer a permanent cluster. Well-dened and stable instances can help reduce public cloud billing costs by closing non-required cycles.

Permanent clusters work well for resources that are always required in set amounts. Building a testing platform with known resources or a security platform are excellent options. e permanent testing platform also has set resources that can be accessed to test operations or run functions across a cloud. A security cluster with this design provides a place to maintain security knowledge more restrictedly. A stable cluster design can prove more manageable to maintain RBAC permissions in the cluster, establish clear logs, and dene some known metrics to manage operations.

<span id="page-71-2"></span><span id="page-71-0"></span>Clusters designed in a permanent architecture incorporate advantages in Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces (REST APIs), no-code applications, and strong relational databases. Since all the data is maintained, the cluster can have a wide range of potential implementations by relying on standing conversion and conguration across multiple toolsets. Examples include using Istio to manage container security across pods or a tool such as Crossplane. Crossplane extends existing APIs by translating all infrastructure calls into Kubernetes-native resources, allowing a consistent, declarative approach and reducing the need for developers to resolve infrastructure issues individually. is change reduces the endpoints users must manage during implementation. ese permanent platforms tend to expand by maintaining known good pipelines and plug-in libraries that allow a large bench of additional applications. Open source tools can be rapidly integrated and used by everyone within the platform if a strong dependency library exists.

e disadvantage of permanent clusters is that they are difficult to change rapidly. Keeping these clusters aligned with new features and releases requires frequently using a different version of the same cluster. Feature upgrades for the platform that occur within the platform can be complex to access when facing a system crash or user issues. ese issues normally result in the company maintaining the platform by owning a development and testing area that is distinct from the permanent platform. ese crashes only become an issue if you are building and operating the platform in addition to working on the platform.

<span id="page-71-1"></span>e other challenge for a permanent design is visualizing resource usage as xed on the initial deployment. Although load balancers can help, in most cases, they are disabled to maintain stable operations across clusters. A design that rapidly increases the pipelines required or pulls large amounts of data on non-regular timelines can cause problems. For example, a system designed to nd <span id="page-72-0"></span>the best sale price on a given item might search numerous databases, including images and metadata. e massive pull for one application might create challenges within the cluster and slow other operations. e solution for these xed designs is implementing a transitory design.

#### Transitory platform architecture

<span id="page-72-2"></span><span id="page-72-1"></span>Transitory platform designs only call resources when needed. ese designs incorporate auto-scaling at multiple steps but focus on creating a known cluster and then adjusting those clusters as needed. Another architectural element within the transitory design is to limit clusters, frequently by time and usage. e collaboration cluster serves as the primary, stable environment within a transitory platform design, but it also offers the exibility for users to spin up additional clusters as specic needs or workloads arise. ese clusters would have an expiration point, such as three months, below a certain compute usage, with inactive users or similar metric-based decision points. For example, when working in collaboration on a new design, I would reach a point where I needed to deploy a segment for testing. I would then use a cluster launch application to launch the CI/CD function for 72 hours. is type of launch could promote the development into a permanent location within those 72 hours, but if operations remained incomplete, the cluster would spin back down. at can be frustrating when you are facing numerous problems.

An advantage of transitory design is knowing the costs. You can implement a limit on initiated clusters and project costs through multiple quarters. Another advantage is that unused resources are always eliminated. ese designs tend to be highly opinionated when creating clusters. e limited nature means fewer options are available for design, but it can be benecial if you already know the dened workspace. ink about it as if you already know that the workshop only needs to produce shelves; there is no reason to maintain machinery capable of making bowls, birdhouses, or statues. ese constraints can limit the cluster but also tend to make it more highly focused.

Transitory designs excel for items that are only required for a dened period, such as soware supporting retail sales, event management, or support during a conference. A company may want to be able to launch many demos at a conference but no longer have those functions available aerward. is design ensures that those additional clusters will disappear when they are no longer needed. e rst disadvantage is that everything constructed on those clusters will eventually disappear. While the code may be maintained, the specic aspects during operations will no longer be present. You may implement a transitory approach to a testing cluster; when you call a test, the cluster running those operations will run the tests, pass the data, and then shut down. ese operational guidelines can be benecial for managing resources.

A second disadvantage of a transitory cluster can be in managing operations. Although you know the cluster will eventually quit, setting those parameters can be difficult. If the parameters are set too high, <span id="page-73-2"></span>you could just as easily use a permanent architecture; if the parameters are too low, then the needed work will remain incomplete. Users can become highly aggravated if all the required work disappears at the penultimate step, and they must return to the beginning of the process. is aggravation can also happen with transitory security platforms when the scans are designed to launch from those clusters. Sometimes, the artifacts are lost if the cluster quits before the security tool concludes.

#### Ephemeral platform architecture

<span id="page-73-1"></span><span id="page-73-0"></span>A third architectural model is ephemeral design. Similar to transitory design, this sets up a cluster that will eventually disappear. Unlike the set guidelines for a transitory approach, ephemeral clusters take advantage of exible load balancing. Ephemeral clusters are only designed to build on commit and then have a set expiration. Whether you are using a development, testing, operations, or security platform, these clusters spin up to complete a task and remove themselves. is cluster creation allows any user to create any number of clusters at any point as deployment targets but uses a metric like active users to decide when to terminate operations.

One key to using ephemeral clusters is ensuring that logging functions report to the collaboration cluster. Any data associated with that cluster disappears, so any long-term metrics or evaluations need to be reported elsewhere. You can see the advantage of running an operations platform ephemerally that spins up clusters to check performance, reports results, and then deprecates to minimize cloud usage. is is best suited to customers with tight budgets or those who are unsure what may be part of a future spending plan.

Ephemeral clusters are best suited for those at either end of the experience spectrum. For those with minimal experience, using a platform with an ephemeral design can allow you to explore platform properties without full commitment. Conversely, those who know exactly what they want, and for how long, can effectively use ephemeral platforms to control costs. One challenge is that each user must know exactly what they want. In the permanent approach, an operations team sets the deployment targets; in the transitory approach, a hybrid approach between an operations team and individual users probably exists; in the ephemeral architecture, each user sets their own needs. is challenge could be mitigated by having templates for various ephemeral clusters. However, setting templates too broadly leads us back into designing an ephemeral cluster and operationally running those functions in a transitory approach.

e ephemeral design maximizes many of the DevOps concepts in creating high availability, low coupling, and easy conguration changes. ese designs are not suited to a production environment as they do not tend to last long enough. Low coupling emerges as every transitory environment contains all the elements necessary to move forward.

Each architectural design provides some benets and some challenges. As a personal approach, I would use a permanent structure for internal development and operations, a transitory design for testing and security, and then an ephemeral platform for research and development. Each organization has its own needs and requirements. Understanding the difference between the structures allows you to quickly identify the tasks needed. ese can be incorporated to consider the tools needed, ingress and egress pathways, and version changes.

<span id="page-74-1"></span>When implemented through a platform, the other benecial aspect of these architectures is the ability to structure for self-service. Understanding the base architecture and then working with a generative AI structure later allows each user to support their own needs through platforms at multiple levels. e more well-dened the architecture, the greater the capability for automated assistants to help. is increases the amount of work completed and reduces the toil from everyday tasks that must be accomplished multiple times.

#### <span id="page-74-2"></span><span id="page-74-0"></span>Summary

is chapter began by explaining the key architectural concepts required to implement Platform Engineering. You start with the SOLID principles and then expand those functions as required for a platform. Platforms are relatively simple, with the basic architecture comprising collaborative clusters and deployment targets. Integrating those concepts allows you to maximize DevOps cultural constructions to obtain consistent and repeated quality.

An initial architecture can then be positioned to optimize scalability, resilience, and security. Scalability facilitates the adjustment of resource usage in either direction to maximize prot instead of spinning clusters without value. Resilient constructions ensure those platforms can perform when faced with external changes from buggy code, constantly changing dependencies, and even physical disasters. Secure platforms are a must for any operator in the modern digital landscape. Information may want to be free, but we must also prioritize protecting customer data from unethical use. We also must be able to secure our own intellectual property to protect long-term prots.

Finally, all the architectural concepts were integrated into moving to cloud-native solutions and then deploying a permanent, transitory, or ephemeral structure to our platform. Each option scales differently, incorporating resilience and demonstrating security. ese platforms can be implemented for development functions, security tasks, operational needs, or testing various constructions.

ese designs lead us to the next step: determining whether the existing culture can support a platform transformation. Aer all, DevOps is a cultural solution, not just a technical one, so the next chapter covers determining the best-t cultures and leadership strategies to adapt fully to platformengineered success.

# <span id="page-76-3"></span><span id="page-76-1"></span><span id="page-76-0"></span>Cultural Transformation and Leadership

Embarking on a journey of cultural transformation and empathic leadership within the realm of Platform Engineering and DevOps requires more than just technical acumen; it demands a shi in mindset and the adoption of strategic frameworks that champion innovation, psychological safety, and a culture of continuous learning and improvement. is chapter delves into the essence of creating such transformative environments, offering insights into the principles and practices that can guide leaders and organizations through the complexities of modern enterprise. It's about cultivating a space where innovation thrives, challenges are embraced, and every team member feels valued and empowered to contribute to their fullest potential.

We'll explore the critical role of cultural transformation and empathic leadership in driving successful Platform Engineering initiatives. We'll examine how Platform Engineering can serve as a catalyst for innovation, empowering teams to build and deliver more effectively. Finally, we'll discuss how to incorporate and integrate strategic frameworks that support organizational change—enhancing business value, fostering psychological safety, and creating the conditions for sustained innovation.

Discover how these elements cultivate an organizational culture that drives technical excellence and human-centered workplaces in Platform Engineering and DevOps. By aligning leadership styles with engineering challenges—such as managing complex team structures, ensuring seamless collaboration, and navigating technical trade-offs—this transformation empowers leaders to foster innovation, enhance teamwork, and implement effective change management. ese principles enable organizations to balance technical decisions with business goals while promoting employee engagement and well-being, ultimately creating resilient, adaptable, and successful organizations.

We will be covering the following main topics:

- e urgency of cultural evolution in a digital-rst world
- Empathy e core of organizational value
- Leadership as the catalyst for empathic change
- Orchestrating cultural transformation e power of strategic frameworks

# <span id="page-76-4"></span><span id="page-76-2"></span>Technical requirements

While this chapter does not have specic technical prerequisites, a foundational understanding of organizational culture, leadership principles, change management, along with Lean, Agile, and

DevOps, methodologies, will enhance the appreciation of the strategic insights and transformative strategies discussed.

# <span id="page-77-7"></span><span id="page-77-0"></span>The urgency of cultural evolution in a digital-first world

<span id="page-77-2"></span>Businesses must reassess their approaches and organizational culture to ensure swi and efficient value creation and thrive in today's digital landscape. e tech industry, particularly Platform Engineering and DevOps, is driving this transformation. We urge businesses to adopt a more Agile, generative culture that aligns with the digital era and move away from hierarchical norms. is shi is essential for companies to excel in the new digital reality.

For instance, the State of Agile Culture 2020-21 Report indicated that organizations with strong Agile cultures experienced up to a 235% improvement in business performance. Similarly, companies fostering generative cultures report signicantly higher employee morale and innovation. Pivotal Soware's transformation is a powerful example—through Agile methodologies and a collaborative environment, Pivotal enhanced its development processes, enabling rapid responses to market shis and customer needs. Another example is FREITAG, which implemented Agile management to boost exibility and adaptability. ese cases demonstrate how Agile and generative cultures drive technical excellence, foster innovation, and build resilience in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

To effectively implement this transformative change, it is imperative to recognize and understand the existing organizational culture. Identifying where your organization currently stands will provide a clear starting point for fostering the generative culture required for business success.

## <span id="page-77-8"></span><span id="page-77-1"></span>Recognizing organizational culture

<span id="page-77-3"></span>Organizations face a critical decision between clinging to outdated methods or embracing transformative change. Westrum's Typology of Cultures provides valuable insights into prevailing attitudes and behaviors that shape an organization's approach to teamwork, information ow, and innovation. e three distinct cultures—pathological, bureaucratic, and generative—help organizations make informed choices and create a culture that drives growth and innovation. For leaders, recognizing where their organization falls within Westrum's typology is the rst critical step toward cultural evolution. It lays the foundation for a strategic shi towards a more open, dynamic, and collaborative organizational culture. Such a transformation is pivotal for leveraging the expansive capabilities of Platform Engineering and DevOps, methodologies that inherently thrive in adaptable, responsive, and generative cultures. Let's take a look at the different cultures:

<span id="page-77-6"></span><span id="page-77-5"></span><span id="page-77-4"></span>Pathological cultures breed fear, siloed functions, and a blame culture, stiing creativity and collaboration. Pathological organizations view messengers of bad news as problems and dismiss them before they can be heard. In such a culture, new ideas <span id="page-78-8"></span><span id="page-78-7"></span><span id="page-78-6"></span><span id="page-78-1"></span>are suppressed with scapegoating and fear. is stiing of innovation can be disastrous in a technology-driven marketplace where adaptability is essential.

- Bureaucratic cultures, with rigid hierarchies and strict adherence to rules, provide structure but hamper agility and innovation. Bureaucratic cultures allow collaboration but within strict boundaries, leading only to opportunistic cooperation.
- Generative cultures are built on trust, open communication, and a shared purpose, creating an environment ripe for innovation, learning from failure, and collective celebration of achievements. Such cultures value messengers of bad news as they are crucial for quick problem-solving and continuous improvement. Generative organizations encourage collaborative effort and shared responsibility. Generative cultures embrace novelty and the innovative spirit.

e main aspects of the three different cultures explained in the list are summarized in the following gure:

<span id="page-78-9"></span><span id="page-78-3"></span><span id="page-78-2"></span>Figure 3.1: Leaders must shift the organizational culture from pathological to generative

It is evident that a cultural shi towards the generative end of Westrum's spectrum is vital for organizations to remain competitive and forward-thinking.

# <span id="page-78-10"></span><span id="page-78-0"></span>Benefits of a generative culture

In the vanguard of competitive innovation, a generative culture is the ideal state for organizations looking to thrive in the digital age. Here, the collective focus shis towards performance, adaptability, and the seamless integration of Platform Engineering and DevOps principles. e benets of such a culture are not just additive; they are exponential:

<span id="page-78-5"></span><span id="page-78-4"></span>Boosted innovation: Generative cultures are fertile ground for innovation. e encouragement of risk-taking, coupled with a noblame approach to failure, liberates creativity and allows new ideas to ourish. is environment allows rapid prototyping, iterative development, and a quicker transition from concept to market-ready solutions.

- <span id="page-79-5"></span>Enhanced collaboration: ese cultures break down silos, promoting an interdisciplinary approach where diverse skill sets converge. Such collaboration leads to holistic problem-solving, where collective expertise drives superior outcomes.
- <span id="page-79-7"></span>Increased agility: A generative culture is synonymous with agility. With its at hierarchies and streamlined decision-making processes, the organization can pivot swily in response to market shis, technological advancements, and evolving customer needs.
- <span id="page-79-6"></span>Higher employee engagement: When employees operate in a culture that values their contributions and fosters their development, engagement skyrockets. Engaged employees are not just more productive; they are advocates for the company and its objectives, driving forward with intrinsic motivation.
- <span id="page-79-8"></span>Resilience and sustainability: Organizations with generative cultures can better withstand market turbulence and disruptions. e resilience built into their cultural DNA ensures sustainability, as they are adept at learning from experiences and emerging stronger from challenges.
- <span id="page-79-2"></span>Attracting and retaining talent: A generative culture is a beacon for top talent. Professionals seek environments that promise growth, learning, and a positive impact. By championing such a culture, organizations become talent magnets, retaining and attracting the best in the eld.
- <span id="page-79-4"></span>Customer-centric solutions: With an empathic approach embedded in the culture, the products and services developed are inherently customer-centric. is alignment with customer needs oen results in higher satisfaction and loyalty, translating to long-term success.

Transitioning to a generative culture is not a mere change; it's an evolution toward organizational enlightenment. It lays the foundation for a company not just to survive but to lead and set the pace in a rapidly evolving ecosystem where those who can adapt with speed and efficiency will dene the future of technology and service delivery.

<span id="page-79-3"></span><span id="page-79-1"></span>For instance, consider Netix. Before its cultural transformation, Netix operated with a more hierarchical structure, characterized by rigid management practices and limited employee autonomy. is environment oen stied innovation and responsiveness to market changes. Recognizing these limitations, Netix underwent a signicant cultural shi, embracing a generative culture rooted in trust and continuous feedback. is transformation empowered teams to innovate rapidly and make data-driven decisions, enabling Netix to outpace competitors and redene the entertainment industry with its Agile, customer-centric approach. By fostering a generative culture rooted in trust and continuous feedback, Netix empowers its teams to innovate rapidly and make data-driven decisions. is cultural shi has enabled Netix to not only stay ahead of its competitors but also redene the entertainment industry.

Organizations must understand that adopting a generative culture demands reengineering the corporate ethos to replicate this success. Leaders must intentionally create a vision that embodies generative ideals and demonstrates trust while championing open dialogue. e following section outlines strategic steps to facilitate this transformation.

# <span id="page-79-9"></span><span id="page-79-0"></span>Strategies for transitioning to a generative culture

<span id="page-80-1"></span><span id="page-80-0"></span>Transitioning to a generative culture is more than simply adopting a new set of policies; it's a fundamental reengineering of corporate ethos. It requires intentionality, unwavering commitment from leadership, and an actionable roadmap that empowers every tier of the organization.

Leaders must create a vision that encapsulates the generative ideals, making them tangible and relatable. ey must exemplify the generative traits they wish to instill, demonstrating trust, championing open dialogue, and embodying the changes they advocate.

An actionable plan for transitioning must include the following strategic points:

- Establishing open communication channels: Cultivate an environment where information ows freely, encouraging transparency and fostering trust. Open forums and regular town hall meetings can democratize information and help dismantle the need-toknow barriers characteristic of pathological cultures.
- Redening failure: Shi the organization's response to failure from scapegoating to learning. Introduce a failure debrief protocol akin to agile retrospectives, where lessons are extracted and celebrated as valuable intel for the organization's continuous learning cycle.
- Championing collaboration: Break down silos by promoting cross-functional teams and interdisciplinary projects. Use shared objectives to unify disparate groups, aligning them with common goals that reinforce the generative model's collaborative spirit.
- Rewarding innovation: Develop systems to recognize and reward innovation. Encourage experimentation by creating innovation labs or hackathons where novel ideas can be explored without the pressure of immediate ROI.
- Leadership training: Implement leadership development programs focused on generative behavior. Equip leaders with the skills to coach rather than command, to inspire rather than enforce.
- Incremental change and quick wins: Start with small, incremental changes to quickly demonstrate the benets of a generative culture. ese quick wins can build momentum and buy-in across the organization.
- Measuring progress: Dene clear metrics to measure the cultural shi. Use surveys, feedback tools, and culture audits to gauge the organization's pulse and adjust strategies as needed.

is evolution is challenging. It demands perseverance, as cultural inertia can be a formidable adversary. Yet, the rewards—a nimble, resilient organization poised for innovation and growth—far outweigh the inertia of comfort zones.

<span id="page-80-2"></span>To support this evolution, leveraging tools such as Jira, Linear, or Asana for transparent project tracking and Slack or Microso Teams for fostering open, real-time communication can help teams collaborate more effectively. Retrospective meetings offer continuous learning and process improvement opportunities, reinforcing psychological safety. However, adopting these strategies in a DevOps setting can face challenges, such as resistance to change from long-established teams. To overcome this, leaders should introduce incremental changes, highlight quick wins, and involve team members early in decision-making to build trust and reduce apprehension. Addressing concerns empathetically and demonstrating the value of these tools and techniques ensures smoother adoption and fosters sustained cultural transformation.

<span id="page-81-2"></span>When executing these strategies, ensure they are not check-box exercises but part of a sincere effort to transform the organization's DNA. As the culture shis from pathological to generative, Platform Engineering and DevOps practices will ourish, unlocking new horizons for growth and enabling the organization to thrive in the digital-rst world.

Now that we've explored the benets and strategies of a generative culture, it's time to delve into actionable steps to cultivate this transformative ethos within your organization, empowering you to lead with innovation and resilience.

# <span id="page-81-4"></span><span id="page-81-0"></span>Cultivating a generative culture – Strategic initiatives for leaders

<span id="page-81-3"></span><span id="page-81-1"></span>To transition effectively to a generative culture, a strategic and sustained effort is required. e following actionable tasks and corresponding insights provide a framework for this profound transformation.

- Educating and aligning leadership: Begin by ensuring leaders are educated about the principles of a generative culture and aligned with the vision for change. Equip them with the knowledge and tools to champion this transformation and align their incentives with its success. is foundational step ensures leadership buy-in, creating a unied front to guide and inspire the rest of the organization through the cultural shi.
- Developing an organizational culture roadmap: Leaders must create a clear roadmap for a successful organizational cultural shi. is roadmap should outline specic objectives, assign accountability, and identify cultural indicators for each transition stage. It is imperative to communicate this roadmap widely so that every employee understands the destination and the journey ahead, fostering trust and buy-in. e roadmap should be a exible, living document that can adapt to the evolving challenges faced during implementation. Key performance indicators such as employee engagement scores, cross-functional collaboration metrics, and innovation rates can be used to track progress toward a generative culture.
- Creating a cultural change taskforce: Establishing a cultural change task force is critical for leading the shi. is team, consisting of members from various levels and functions within the organization, serves as the cultural ambassadors. ey facilitate open discussions, champion generative culture, and provide diverse perspectives. is inclusivity ensures that the shi resonates across the organization. Leaders can effectively diffuse generative principles throughout the organization by fostering ownership of the cultural transition.
- Implementing a cultural feedback loop: To truly evolve a company's culture, there must be a mechanism for ongoing dialogue and feedback that values input from all levels of the organization. Leaders can establish a cultural feedback loop through periodic surveys, open forums, or dedicated channels for continuous feedback. Tools such as Conuence for shared knowledge, Slack or Microso Teams for live discussions, and Pulse surveys integrated with collaboration platforms can be used to collect and act on feedback effectively, ensuring alignment across teams. Crucially, leaders must address feedback with responsiveness to drive culture forward and reinforce the principles of a generative culture: transparency, collaboration, and continual learning. is not only benets the company but also inspires employees to participate and contribute to the company's growth.

![](_page_90_Figure_0.jpeg)

<span id="page-90-1"></span>Figure 3.4: Six simple steps to become an empathic leader

Leadership is not about titles but the impact of your actions. Empathic leaders guide their teams through uncertainty, drive innovation, and create an environment that fosters transformative success. Committing to these simple steps can spark signicant change in your professional domain. Building a culture of psychological safety is essential, and celebrating failure is crucial for innovation in Platform Engineering. e principles of empathic leadership are not just benevolent but strategic.

One of the critical components that support this approach is psychological safety. Let's explore why psychological safety is paramount for innovation and its pivotal role in Platform Engineering.

# <span id="page-90-3"></span><span id="page-90-0"></span>Psychological safety – The bedrock of innovation

<span id="page-90-2"></span>Psychological safety is vital to modern organizational practices, especially in high-stakes functions such as Platform Engineering and DevOps. It encourages a collaborative culture that empowers individuals to speak up, share ideas, express concerns, and admit mistakes without fear of retaliation. is foundation is critical to fostering innovation and success in any business.

For example, Google's research on high-performing teams revealed that psychological safety was the most critical factor inuencing team effectiveness. In a Platform Engineering context, the lack of psychological safety can lead to suppressed concerns about awed code deployments, ultimately resulting in extended downtime or security breaches. Conversely, fostering psychological safety enables engineers to identify and resolve issues proactively, leading to measurable outcomes such as faster incident response times, reduced system downtime, and increased deployment frequency. By cultivating a safe space for open dialogue and collaboration, organizations can unlock the full potential of their teams, driving operational excellence and innovation.

Leaders play a pivotal role in nurturing this culture. It begins with their mindset: seeing the organization as a collective where every voice holds value, curiosity is championed over immediate judgment, and learning is celebrated as execution. e empathic leader recognizes that psychological safety is the fertile ground from which the seeds of innovation sprout. ey understand that how they respond to failures, handle conicts, and set the tone for communication directly shapes the team's comfort in taking intellectual risks.

<span id="page-91-2"></span>By fostering an environment where team members can admit to not knowing, the organization is taking its rst step toward learning more. When leaders dismantle the barriers of fear, they liberate their teams from the shackles of conformity. In doing so, they enable a depth of creative thinking and collaboration that drives groundbreaking solutions. Leaders who earnestly endeavor to build psychologically safe workplaces are constructing the very scaffoldings upon which the future of Platform Engineering will rise, innovate, and ultimately triumph.

A crucial aspect of building such a culture is how an organization approaches failure. Embracing and celebrating failures can become a powerful catalyst for innovation and growth. Let's explore how recognizing failure as an opportunity for learning and improvement can drive resilience and creativity within any organization.

# <span id="page-91-3"></span><span id="page-91-0"></span>Embracing and celebrating failures

<span id="page-91-1"></span>Embracing failures is a powerful catalyst for innovation, learning, and resilience within any organization. A culture that recognizes failure as a stepping stone to success fosters an environment of growth and continuous improvement. By shiing our mindset from viewing failure as a setback to embracing it as validated learning, we encourage the organization to take calculated risks and explore new possibilities.

In engineering contexts, metrics such as MTTR, change failure rate, and error budget burn rate provide concrete ways to monitor and celebrate failure tolerance. For example, a low MTTR indicates that the team is effectively learning from failures and recovering quickly while tracking change failure rate highlights areas for improvement in deployment processes. Similarly, error budget burn rate ensures a balance between innovation and system stability, allowing teams to take calculated risks without compromising reliability. ese metrics quantify resilience and help teams visualize progress in cultivating a failure-tolerant culture.

Leaders can further enhance this approach by implementing regular empathy and team dynamic assessments. Simple exercises, such as conducting postmortem retrospectives that emphasize blameless analysis or using team surveys to gauge psychological safety and trust levels, can provide valuable insights into the organization's readiness to embrace failure. Checklists to evaluate how frequently lessons from failures are shared and integrated into processes help leaders consistently focus on growth and innovation.

<span id="page-92-0"></span>Leaders who embrace the notion that one team's failure is a learning opportunity for the entire organization encourage a culture of collective growth and knowledge-sharing. is approach aligns with DevOps and Platform Engineering principles, where the iterative process of build, measure, and learn is fundamental. Businesses can build resilient, innovative teams that drive success by emphasizing learning from mistakes and focusing on team growth.

In hypothesis-driven development, only some experiments will succeed—the team factors the probability of failure into the cost of innovation. When a hypothesis doesn't yield the expected outcome, the organization should use it as a learning opportunity to improve future projects. Penalizing the team is counterproductive. Insights gained from dissecting the failure can inform future projects.

Perfection is like the horizon – unattainable, yet continuously pursued. e pursuit of excellence is an ongoing journey, not a nal destination. Organizations must embrace this concept to create a safe space for employees to express their creativity, propose new ideas, and challenge the status quo without fear of negative repercussions. Doing so leads to a culture of innovation and growth.

In this journey toward excellence, it's essential to recognize that progress oen stems from embracing imperfection. Organizations oen struggle with the misconception that every process must be perfect before automation can be implemented. However, perfection is not a prerequisite for progress. For example, some companies delay automating workows because certain steps remain too complex for current tools. A more effective approach is automating straightforward, repetitive tasks rst, allowing humans to handle the nuanced or complex steps. is hybrid approach accelerates operational efficiency and frees employees to focus on higher-value activities, fostering creativity and innovation. Organizations can unlock signicant value by embracing incremental improvements without waiting for unattainable perfection.

Leaders must safeguard their teams from the negative consequences of failure and create a culture of trust that encourages innovation. When employees feel supported, they are more likely to engage in behaviors that drive the organization forward rather than retreating into self-preservation modes that can stagnate growth. Leaders who prioritize protecting their teams from failure foster a sense of security that enables their employees to take calculated risks and achieve success.

However, leaders who wish to embrace failure must also be cognizant of the impact of their decisions on psychological safety. Abrupt decisions such as layoffs can undermine trust and safety, which are critical for encouraging people to take risks. Such actions can create a culture of fear, leading to lower morale, productivity, and innovation. Furthermore, it can alter a generative culture into a pathological one, which is antithetical to Platform Engineering and DevOps goals.

Effective leaders must lead with empathy to turn failures into opportunities for growth. Creating an environment where employees feel safe to share their failures will enable an organization to harness the full potential of its people and pivot failures into powerful learnings that drive success.

Embracing failure is essential in Platform Engineering. Agile and DevOps methodologies are built on it. Failure is the bedrock of rapid iteration and continuous feedback. It's what drives sustained innovation and competitive advantage for forward-thinking organizations.

Let's inspire teams to appreciate the learning that comes from failures. Every team member should feel safe and valued and contribute to collective success.

#### DISPEL THE MYTH THAT "FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION"

In a world of lean experimentation, what some call failure, empathic leaders see as unintended outcomes. Challenge the unrealistic desire for infallibility—100% uptime,zero defects—are these realistic, or do they hinder innovation? If each result teaches us something new, isn't that a form of success? Ask yourself, when is the pursuit of perfection actually a barrier to progress?

e role of an empathic leader is crucial in fostering this environment. Empathetic leadership goes beyond understanding; it involves creating a nurturing atmosphere where everyone feels valued and safe to express their ideas and learn from failures. Let's examine how empathic leaders can drive innovation through their unique approach.

Using tools such as DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time for changes) helps teams focus on outcomes that matter most to the business.
- <span id="page-97-3"></span>Workow optimization: Efficiency is paramount, but not at the cost of efficacy. Workow optimization in Platform Engineering means streamlining processes to deliver value quicker, reducing friction in the value stream, and optimizing the ow of value from conception to customer. It's a meticulous orchestration of tasks, ensuring that each step is rened for maximum impact with minimum waste. Techniques such as value stream mapping and tools such as Planview help identify and address bottlenecks. For example, automating repetitive tasks such as CI/CD deployments enables teams to deliver faster while maintaining quality.
- <span id="page-97-0"></span>Empower: e true potential of a team is unleashed when each member is empowered. In Platform Engineering, empowerment involves equipping teams with tools such as self-service developer portals and providing autonomy to make decisions. Empowerment ensures that developers can innovate without being hindered by dependencies or bottlenecks, fostering a culture of ownership and accountability. For instance, introducing a provisioning dashboard allows developers to deploy resources independently, accelerating development cycles.
- <span id="page-97-2"></span>Reduce manual toil: Automation is the backbone of modern Platform Engineering, but its real aim is to reduce manual toil. is is not merely a pursuit of convenience but a strategic move to liberate human intellect for higher-order thinking. is principle is exemplied by tools such as Terraform for infrastructure as code or automated testing pipelines. Reducing manual toil enables teams to focus on creativity, innovation, and strategic problem-solving while eliminating repetitive, error-prone tasks. By eliminating repetitive tasks, we allow creativity and strategy to ourish, paving the way for innovation and growth.

Each of these components of the POWER framework is a cog in the business value machine to create an ecosystem where Platform Engineering is not just a function but a strategic advantage. It's a mindset that permeates through every layer of the organization, empowering teams, optimizing workows, and delivering on the promise of technology with purpose and precision.

Figure 3.6 highlights the POWER framework, detailing its essential pillars: Purpose, Outcomes, Workow Optimization, Empowerment, and Reducing Manual Toil, as drivers of organizational excellence.

#### <span id="page-99-2"></span>Incorporating other transformation frameworks

<span id="page-99-1"></span><span id="page-99-0"></span>Integrating the POWER framework with venerable change models such as Kotter's 8-Step Change Model and the McKinsey 7-S Framework creates a multidimensional strategy for organizational transformation that aligns seamlessly with Platform Engineering and DevOps initiatives. is integration ensures that the pursuit of transformation is not merely sequential but holistic, recognizing the multifaceted nature of change.

Purpose becomes the guiding principle, akin to Kotter's creation of urgency and McKinsey's shared values, underscoring the mission that mobilizes and unites teams toward a common goal. e POWER framework ensures that the organization's heartbeat is synchronized with the rhythm of change, driving every initiative forward with clarity and conviction.

Outcomes are the tangible benchmarks, reecting Kotter's vision and strategies and McKinsey's system, where strategic goals and tangible results dene the success of Platform Engineering projects. By delineating clear objectives, the POWER framework operationalizes the vision, setting ambitious yet achievable milestones and ensuring that every technological advancement contributes to the organization's overarching goals.

Workow Optimization in the POWER framework leverages Lean principles to minimize waste and maximize value, mirroring the continuous enhancement ethos of Platform Engineering. is streamlining is further bolstered by Kotter's notion of enabling action and the structural alignment within McKinsey's framework, ensuring that every process is rened for peak performance.

In Empower, we amalgamate Kotter's empowerment for broad-based action and McKinsey's style and staff elements to create a culture of autonomy and decisive action. e POWER framework recognizes that for Platform Engineering to thrive, teams need the tools and the authority to innovate and make impactful decisions.

e focus on Reducing Manual Toil resonates with Lean's drive toward efficiency and the technical agility inherent in DevOps. It reects a strategic pivot from rote tasks to cognitive, innovative work, enhancing job satisfaction and sparking creative problem-solving.

is strategy does not suggest merely adopting a new framework; it champions a transformative paradigm and calls on leaders to recalibrate their approach. Integrating the POWER framework with these established change models arms leaders with a dynamic array of tools for managing

transformation. It affords a nuanced view of the organization, aligning operational aspects with the agility and innovation demanded by modern Platform Engineering.

## <span id="page-103-4"></span><span id="page-103-1"></span>The Platform Engineering Ecosystem

Recently, Platform Engineering has become a staple for those interested in DevOps solutions to accelerate time to market. Just like DevOps engineers, platform engineers have become the up-andcoming roles to hire as a new skill set to potentially x old problems. Platform Engineering is not just about installing a single soware solution or implementing conguration as code but adjusting the entire delivery ecosystem. Ecosystems are systems of interacting parts, in this case, all the parts needed to create an operational environment. Good platforms incorporate numerous tools and capabilities to achieve success. Integrating those tools within different aspects of the platform is a key element of effective platforms. Further, those tools should be incorporated into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines through a DevOps methodology.

<span id="page-103-3"></span>In this chapter, you'll gain insights into selecting and integrating the tools and practices that align with your platform strategy. We'll explore how to incorporate essential tools into various platform architectures and identify the technologies that most effectively support platform performance and scalability. You'll also learn how to implement Kubernetes-based solutions for building and managing containers across the platform. Finally, we'll cover how to integrate pipelines into the platform build, focusing on how platforms manage these pipelines to ensure reliability, scalability, and consistent delivery of new features.

We will be covering the following main topics:

- e essential platform ecosystem tools
- Orchestrating the platform ecosystem
- Platform soware delivery ecosystems

e three sections in this chapter each address the key areas to understand to integrate platforms. e rst section discusses legacy tools through building infrastructure, addressing baseline congurations, and integrating version control. e next section deals with orchestrating the system to ensure all pieces function correctly. Finally, the last section discusses converting the platform into a delivery engine, expediting the delivery of production applications to the user.

## <span id="page-103-5"></span><span id="page-103-2"></span>The essential Platform Engineering tools

Starting an ecosystem can be challenging. When we think about ecosystems, we typically think about how to integrate with an existing ecosystem rather than building one from scratch. You must consider <span id="page-104-1"></span>not only the tools desired but also the conjunction of those tools in operating successfully. A platform with broad tool options that do not interact with each other can increase operation costs and provide only a small amount of value, if any. Integrating a platform ecosystem requires evaluating and comparing multiple interactions to nd the best t for your organization.

A number of years ago, one of us received a locked aquarium with a plant, a snail, and two African Dwarf frogs in about 350 milliliters of water as a holiday gi. e idea was that the ecosystem would be self-sustainable: the frogs would eat the plant and the snail would eat the waste. Every participant would be happy, and no external cleaning would be required other than the occasional feeding. e drawback was that the frogs required 7.5 liters of water each to be social. is meant the frogs rst killed the snail and then fought each other to the death. At rst, we thought that the snail and the frog had been sick, so we simply replaced them. e same thing happened several times before we realized what was happening. At that point, we decided to leave a single frog in the tank, with a plant, and we had to clean the tank regularly. e ecosystem was much different from what had been intended. e same thought applies to the platform ecosystem. Platforms that are too small consume local resources and prevent broad expansion. ere must be an expert balance for the platform to function successfully.

Engineering an effective platform goes beyond just identifying different pieces that worked well in a different scenario. Many times, we have seen a presentation at a conference or an online demonstration that offers multiple different, and apparently integrated, capabilities. In some cases, the integration was the result of signicant manual work, and in others, those translations happened behind the scenes within a proprietary soware black box. Combining those elements within the platform you build requires identifying those linkages and nding the best way to make them work consistently. e goal is a single platform that offers integrated success for anyone involved, moving beyond the individual developer to a broad scope of activities.

<span id="page-104-2"></span><span id="page-104-0"></span>Beyond simple integration, two other elements should be considered within a platform ecosystem: compute and storage. Remember, using the cloud means using someone else's servers. Compute describes the resources available to conduct computing actions and manage threads through the virtual CPUs available. Storage relates to the persistent disk space available on those instances. AWS offers EC2 instances with set numbers, while Azure tends to separate by function, as does Google. A sample of the top-level options for the various functions is shown as follows:

| Amazon EC2 |      |           | Azure |                                                | Google                                               |                                                  |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

Figure 4.1: Sample environments

As AWS was the rst to implement this, their cloud offerings provide detail to a more technical specication as the rst purchasers wanted to know exactly what they received. e later entrants in selling cloud space offer a more packaged format, to integrate with the functions the customer desires. Each of these providers offers multiple offerings beyond basic compute, some of which may be benecial in engineering your platform.

Functionally derived options tend to use autoscaling, which can create challenges in assessing pricing early. Techniques can be used to automatically adjust compute and store resources based on demand, meaning you never miss a customer. But this can also lead to excessive charges if a developer leaves an instance running. Another detail is whether you require basic CPUs to host apps or are diving into a machine learning application that requires GPU access from the cloud provider. A third key element for the cloud provider is bandwidth for how fast cloud machines communicate with external users. Any type of platform will require some detailed research on best-t cloud options, which, unfortunately, is beyond the scope of this chapter.

ere are many different elements to consider when developing a unique platform ecosystem. We will dive further into some of the technical and process elements required to bring those various tools to life in the platform. As with the frog scenario, you want to be sure that the included elements have sufficient space and then interact together. Some tools require cloud connections, a larger amount of compute, or more storage available to conduct multiple activities. Each of those interactions must be addressed when building an effective ecosystem.

<span id="page-105-2"></span><span id="page-105-1"></span><span id="page-105-0"></span>e next section breaks down the pieces in order to discuss the constraints and challenges associated with each element. In [Chapter](#page-33-0) 1, these additions were considered from a generic standpoint of what was possible in engineering. [Chapter](#page-55-0) 2 then added where these pieces t into the overall architecture. is section addresses the Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Conguration Management (CM), version control, and monitoring solution elements. e next section addresses specic demands for

Kubernetes and service mesh options, while the last considers CI/CD. is allows us to explore the required elements in greater depth.

## <span id="page-106-5"></span><span id="page-106-0"></span>Infrastructure as code

<span id="page-106-4"></span>When starting with a platform, we should think about everything that follows as IaC. is means that all the basic parts of the environment are unpacked and connected to the initial installation. is allows for the unpacking of all the material all at once. You can think about this as having movers who leave all the boxes in the living room versus movers who unpack all the boxes to place items in the same conguration as in the previous house. is provides advantages in rapidly being able to update new versions and automating those unpacking elements, as well as reducing the need to manually congure items when unpacking.

<span id="page-106-3"></span><span id="page-106-1"></span>e previous chapter mentioned using Terraform as a declarative language. Declarative IaC means only the end requirements are specied, while the platform, in this case, Terraform, handles the steps. e other option is imperative code, where the exact elements are dened and the interpreting system does not deviate from those steps. Chef is an example of an imperative tool. Examples of declarative IaC with Terraform are shown here:

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
   aws = {
      source = "PlatformOps/aws"
      version = "~> 3.15"
    }
 }
required_version = ">= 1.2.0"
}
 provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
resource "aws_instance" "ops_server" {
  ami = "ami-830c94e3"
  instance_type = "t3.large"
tags = {
  Name = "ExampleOpServer"
  }
}
```

You can see how various high-level categories are called through the script. In using an imperative language, each call relates to a lower-level script to call forward. When Terraform calls a resource or a version that has backend information, it allows the code to create the required elements. As an example, this would create a t3.large EC2 instance that sets an IP address, allows user access, manages security, and coordinates interactions without specifying those elements directly in the code. Instead of listing the provider and resources within the code, the language in Chef would call a script that had those items listed as a distinct le. Chef's features help align all the different code elements but can still pose challenges over time. Writing and developing in Chef are completely different areas of study. As a quick reference, Chef uses cookbooks that contain resources, or recipes as a collection of resources. A resource is a Ruby block stating a type, a name, properties associated with values, and a set of actions. However, within the Chef community, many recipes and cookbooks already exist that can be quickly modied to apply to your use case. Here is a sample of the format, and then what a resource line might look like to install an open source Java development kit, or OpenJDK:

```
Type 'name' do attribute 'value' action :type_of_actionend
Package 'java-1.8.0-openjdk do action :installend
```

ese lines then use a similar approach to generate recipes that are composed of a number of resources. e functions can be linked together into the overall cookbook to execute the infrastructure across the desired platform. You can easily see the increased control allowed with the imperative approach but also the increased time required to build and deliver. e Chef exception is when a community element already provides sufficient services.

<span id="page-107-3"></span>In implementing a platform infrastructure, imperative code would build a unique tool set based on local instructions every time, while with declarative code, high-level modications could be made to alter instances, clusters, and additional tools. Many third-party tools that you may want to use in infrastructure already have their portion of IaC developed. e challenge becomes integrating those declarative and imperative elements into an overall element that creates the platform. at initial IaC should set code versions, potential linkages, and cloud structures. Obviously, the full IaC for your platform will likely be much longer. Implementing IaC provides some signicant security benets, such as traceability, version control, and reducing manual intervention for routine xes. Part of a successful IaC integration depends on how it implements CM tools to congurations beyond the initial environment variables.

## <span id="page-107-4"></span><span id="page-107-0"></span>Configuration management tools

<span id="page-107-2"></span>e primary goal for our CM tools is to structure hardware and soware usage. An initial interpretation may be that good CM practice means only authorized changes are allowed within a system. When examining our DevOps practices, the goal becomes to automate those congurations, allowing easy deployment. Implementing these goals moves system administration from a manual approach to an automated solution. For example, when setting up an EC2 cloud on Amazon, you can choose the size, the Linux distribution desired, security features, and a variety of other options. ese selections allow the management of resources on demand, with each user selecting the desired

options, rather than depending on a third party. e traditional practice was submitting a ticket to a help desk, waiting for resolution, and hoping all the parameters were correct. Automation removes the bottleneck and enables a faster ow.

One challenge with CM from the platform context is that each element requires some conguration elements. While the initial IaC provides some options, further conguration requires additional changes. Adds in version control, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes implementation also require managed conguration approaches. e challenge is in separating the various CM elements into manageable and integrated pieces. Returning to the denition of approving only authorized pieces, our platform CM tools should be the ones that are in between the initial system launch and the ongoing development work. Going back to our woodshop analogy from previous chapters, think about CM as how the different tools are placed on the workbench for different users. Good CM can be applied at multiple levels, but this denition has some limits for effective learning.

e best practices for our CM mean we can assign an identication, baseline, version control and audit practices against a regular process. e previous chapter discussed using Ansible, Chef, and Puppet to deploy and control CM. With IaC creating the framework and interactions between all the tools, CM should then approach how those tools are structured within the process. As an example, our IaC deploys an IDE, a workow tool, a chat function, and a CI/CD process. What we want to do with conguration is create one place where a new user can access those applications and virtual devices.

One example would be using a Terraform instance to create accounts within all those different tools when an overall CM tool is utilized. When starting, this splash page would provide a basic introductory view. e user would then create some workow structure likely based on an organization, team, and individual user. e organization level would create properties to allow a certain set of tools to be used. For example, one user group on the platform might want exclusively Go-based tools, while another might need Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda. e CM tool links those tools, allowing teams to be created with those same tools, and then moving to users. Figure 4.2 demonstrates how these links might be constructed:

![](_page_109_Figure_0.jpeg)

<span id="page-109-1"></span>Figure 4.2: Configuration management example

You can see the wide selection of possible tools at the organization level, which are whittled down to only the tools needed for the team. is helps to manage license control and reduce costs. In the example, if Tool 1 was an asynchronous chat tool such as Mattermost, it might be shared between teams, while Tool 8 might be a GitHub application that allows each team to manage their own version control. en, the teams differ on which other applications might be used. ese selections can be expanded to allow for one toolset within the collaboration environment and another in the deployment targets, allowing shared pipelines and CI/CD spaces as well.

In looking at the links between tools, some of the important elements are the specication for which features are allowed, specied endpoints, and connections to secret services that hold passwords and encryption keys. ese systems might be shared but proper CM ensures only the right person accesses them at the right time. e next aspects of CM tie into version control by only allowing the right soware to reach production. is is because an effective version control tool can manage conguration settings as well as soware settings.

#### <span id="page-109-4"></span><span id="page-109-0"></span>Software version control systems

<span id="page-109-3"></span><span id="page-109-2"></span>Soware Version Control Systems (VCSs), sometimes referred to as source control, are the functions that allow tracking and implementing soware code changes. eir primary purpose is to deliver consistent quality across a process, ensuring all users are submitting through the same function. e most widely known tool for VCS is GitHub. GitLab expands its capabilities, and both offer additional <span id="page-110-1"></span>paid options. Some alternative VCSs, are Bitbucket, Subversion (SVN), and Mercurial, which offer a different perspective. e most important element is tracking the original code and then managing forks and branches to this code, as well as integrating those changes into new baselines. Each of these comes with multiple options to display and demonstrate integration. GitKraken, in their web documentation [\(https://www.gitkraken.com/](https://www.gitkraken.com/)), shows how different versions can be visually displayed.

<span id="page-110-0"></span>When visiting the page, one can see samples of various GitKraken implementations. e different colors and branching lines on a GitKraken model show how different changes link to the main source code. Blue lines show the baseline code while the green, purple, and indigo branches show when the code has been split. is allows determining exactly where a change was made and what was included.

To understand the VCS options, we must briey review what might be included. e basic approach remains relatively simple: you establish a repository and then allow users to duplicate it to make corrections. e most common options integrate distributed version control, allowing multiple users to work at the same time. Repositories can include a single set that must be replicated or multiple le branches allowing users to work on an entire element or a smaller set. Examine the following gure to see how those options might be integrated:

![](_page_110_Figure_3.jpeg)

Figure 4.3: Version control illustration

Similar to the GitKraken illustration, but without the pretty colors, the preceding gure shows how different teams can branch different versions to work. e diagram indicates that one set of teams can work on an isolated application to build SSO integration and user tools, another can work on system

<span id="page-111-3"></span>admin tools and database recovery, while a third team can work on documentation. If these branches do not overlap, then each can be fully tested and reintroduced without affecting other teams. If they do overlap, good VCSs allow approving specic changes. When the two branches are merged back to the repository and then deployed, all the changes would be visible to the user. Each merge is accompanied by pipeline results, merge requests, and approvals, showing exactly where each change became a part of the baseline.

## <span id="page-111-4"></span><span id="page-111-0"></span>Legacy tool observability

<span id="page-111-2"></span>Merely deploying the different tools is not sufficient. You must be able to observe that all elements are functioning correctly and establish metrics. As an easy reference, three basic metrics can be used for each of the preceding elements to create observability. ese categories with the associated metrics are listed here:

- <span id="page-111-1"></span>Infrastructure as code: Deployed version, Lead Time to Change (LTC), system operations.
- Conguration as code: Deployed version, time to restore, bug reports.
- Version control systems: Deployment frequency, LTC, value stream ow.

When deploying IaC, there are three key observability elements. e rst element is the deployed version. Since each IaC element deploys a complete package, it is important to know the version. is allows for changes in security controls, operational items, and other features. If you establish the platform as a core element within the DevOps process, then measuring the LTC shows the difference between each new version. All metrics should be correlated and measured at multiple levels, including individual, team, project, and organization. is allows an organization to measure how long it takes to adapt or change the overall platform. Also important is the inuence of various events on the overall value stream. IaC should also create initial dashboards showing elements for storage and compute usage at a minimum. ese operational metrics create the ability to plan resource usage and manage system operability.

Monitoring conguration as code enables some key metrics across the platform. When deploying congurations, similar to managing infrastructure, you must always know which congurations customers are executing and in which clusters. is allows quick analysis when problems occur to determine whether they are user errors or system problems. is leads to the next metric, understanding the time to restore. When a platform supports rapid development for multiple teams, any bugs must be addressed quickly. e common understanding is that bugs are things the system should do but does not, compared to new features, which are things you want the system to do but do not appear in the current baseline. e last critical metric is understanding those bug reports and

being able to compile an overall perspective of how conguration as code functions within the platform.

<span id="page-112-2"></span>e last section, and most clearly tied to the DevOps Research Association (DORA) metrics, is understanding the VCS. e DORA metrics are deployment frequency, mean time to change, change failure rate, mean time to recover. e distinction between baseline code, forks, branches, and integration allows you to analyze deployment frequency, that is, how oen new code deploys. is integrates with the LTC in showing how long an organization takes to submit a new idea, develop new code, and then push that code into production. e rst two metrics then support the broader value stream ow analysis for how the deployed code directly supports prot. One of the main goals of having efficient platforms is rapid protability, so understanding how much each new version costs and the revenue generated is key to enabling the high-level adoption of platform models within the organization.

<span id="page-112-4"></span>We will now take those initial concepts and bring them together. is section has outlined all the pieces required before you even start creating a platform. e next section details the path to start creating a production application.

## <span id="page-112-8"></span><span id="page-112-0"></span>Orchestrating the platform ecosystem

<span id="page-112-7"></span>At this point in the DevOps journey, in moving forward from initial DevOps implementations in 2011, most companies understand that containers and microservices are the primary tools for success. Not all successful models require microservices; some can still use monolith-type approaches to gain success, but those instances are few. e following is an explanation of the two approaches:

- <span id="page-112-5"></span>Microservices: Architectural model using loosely coupled, focused services with logical operations based on reusable capability in using lightweight protocols to maximize cloud compute and store functions.
- <span id="page-112-6"></span>Monolith: Single, unied soware application, entirely self-contained and independent. Tends to lack exibility for revision and reversion especially when developers are working in parallel.

Delivering cutting-edge soware, maintaining constant updates, and eliminating bugs requires teams of developers to make rapid changes without worrying about infrastructure. Container-based systems work based on efficient container orchestration systems and integrated monitoring across multiple clusters.

## <span id="page-112-9"></span><span id="page-112-1"></span>Container orchestration systems

<span id="page-112-3"></span>e standard for most container orchestration remains Kubernetes. Kubernetes functions as a portable, extensible model for managing containerized workloads with a wide range of services <span id="page-113-2"></span><span id="page-113-1"></span><span id="page-113-0"></span>available. Alternatives are systems such as Docker Swarm and Apache Mesos, which present simpler, albeit less feature-rich, options. In a traditional deployment model, one operating system runs all the applications. is has moved to virtualized services where a shared hypervisor creates different virtual machines, each with its own operating system. Container models, such as Kubernetes, share the system kernel between multiple containers to better manage the efficiency of individual containers.

e primary advantage of running containers is a distinction between the build and release cycles compared to deployed functions. Containers have three primary attributes: they should be distributed, ephemeral, and immutable. Distributed means containers can operate in multiple machines, clusters, zones, or regions with the same effects. Multiple instantiations can support similar functions and report back to a common database while maintaining operational integrity. Ephemeral means you never depend on a single running container but on the base code supporting instantiating the same container across multiple clusters to generate similar effects. is allows the creation of temporary and replaceable effects. Containers do not get xed; you build a new image and destroy the old container when the new one deploys. Finally, good container programming is immutable, meaning once deployed, while the data through those containers can be modied, the baseline code never changes. Maximizing these three characteristics is one of the reasons Kubernetes approaches have been so successful from among the orchestration choices. e following gure (Figure 4.4) demonstrates a high-level architecture for each of these orchestration concepts:

![](_page_113_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 4.4: Kubernetes architecture

Kubernetes offers several advantages over traditional hosting approaches. ese advantages include service discovery, load balancing, automated rollout, self-healing approaches, and secrets management. When implementing Kubernetes, other benets oen appear but the aforementioned advantages are the primary benets to successful Platform Engineering. Service discovery enables you to use embedded commands to discover which containers are currently running, while load balancing distributes compute and store needs across multiple containers. Service discovery can expand to allow containers to nd and communicate with each other as well, a critical function when dealing with microservices. Automated rollout refers to linking deployments to the CI/CD process, ensuring only current versions are available to the user. e self-healing approach integrates load balancing and good security practices by ensuring that whenever a container fails, the system can kill the process and launch another container with minimal user impact. Finally, secrets management allows secrets such as passwords and program keys to be centrally stored and encrypted while still being accessible to multiple container deployments.

![](_page_114_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 4.5: Docker architecture

Docker offers a different approach through an open platform that distinguishes applications from infrastructure. is system creates images and containers while using namespaces to preserve the isolated workspace within the container. Docker Swarm varies from Kubernetes in that it is tied to the <span id="page-115-1"></span>Docker API, rather than being an independent solution. You still use nodes, services, and load balancers to manage actions, but the connection to the Docker API makes it more linear than Kubernetes. While being potentially easier to install at rst, the functionality and automation are limited compared to the Kubernetes toolbase. A clear example is that Docker only uses Transport-Level Security (TLS), while Kubernetes can use multiple security options through RBAC, SSL, TLS, and various secrets management tools. Another example is that Docker Swarm only monitors through third-party integrations, while Kubernetes has both internal monitoring and third-party options.

![](_page_115_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 4.6: Mesos architecture

e third orchestration system, Apache Mesos, takes another design approach to address more advanced containers and data distribution. is leads Mesos to be primarily a resource management tool, ensuring containers can reach the right databases, make appropriate requests and changes, and maintain high availability. is approach enables supporting tens of thousands of nodes, which can be difficult for other applications. Mesos is not technically a container orchestration tool but a higherlevel function that can support tools running container orchestration. Within Mesos, the Marathon tool is the one that provides those functions. Like Docker, Mesos does not have an integrated monitoring solution but can manage containers to report on those solutions. e core goal of Mesos is executing diverse workloads on a common platform.

<span id="page-115-0"></span>You should remember that no container orchestration system solves all problems, which is why it is merely part of the overall platform solution. Each of these tools could play a part within Platform

Engineering, but the rst step is choosing the development community supported. Docker offers quick options for application developers to move into microservices and run something. Kubernetes uses Docker containers but also integrates with the underlying infrastructure. Mesos specializes in running organization-critical workloads on thousands of machines and across multiple data centers. is comparison helps with picking the right platform. For most platforms, Kubernetes will be the easy choice. For start-ups focused on reaching market, Docker Swarm likely becomes the best option. For a mature business running thousands of containers and globally integrated databases, Mesos will likely be the best option. Our targeted community is that middle ground, building a stable platform, integrating infrastructure, allowing observability, and managing resources, which is why most examples in this book will suggest Kubernetes.

#### <span id="page-116-4"></span><span id="page-116-0"></span>Kubernetes interfaces

<span id="page-116-3"></span><span id="page-116-1"></span>ere are two substantial Kubernetes interfaces that are critical to mention in building a platform. e rst is Crossplane [\(https://www.crossplane.io/\)](https://www.crossplane.io/), which connects Kubernetes within the cluster to external, non-Kubernetes resources. is uses a Custom Resource Denition (CRD) to represent external functions as native Kubernetes objects so each responds to standard Kubernetes commands (Figure 4.5).

<span id="page-116-2"></span>![](_page_116_Figure_3.jpeg)

Figure 4.7: Crossplane integration

is overwrites some of the advantages of Docker Swarm in using a common API by making a Kubernetes API that treats all external functions similarly. You can then implement a Kubernetes solution without having the end-state resource or container written in Kubernetes, limiting the burden on the developer. Crossplane can be a key advantage in controlling Platform Engineering within your platform design. Investigating emerging tools such as Crossplane can help with nding missing pieces in your platform orchestration.

<span id="page-117-3"></span><span id="page-117-2"></span>Another type of common tool associated with Kubernetes involves sidecar security, such as Istio (<https://istio.io/>) or Linkerd [\(https://linkerd.io/\)](https://linkerd.io/). Both tools provide an open source service mesh to enhance orchestration capabilities. ese service mesh tools add functions such as traffic management and security, and can increase observability without having to refactor the company's own code. ese functions operate using a transparent process linked to service instances. A comparison can be made to how OTel operates within the containers; these tools operate next to the container at the service mesh level. Each takes advantage of Kubernetes interactions to establish a control plane to integrate data. When previously discussing architectural patterns, challenges in maintaining observability were discussed. ese tools can integrate observability and management into common functions without disrupting application development.

## <span id="page-117-6"></span><span id="page-117-0"></span>Monitoring and logging

<span id="page-117-4"></span>Prometheus offers powerful monitoring capabilities and works particularly well with Kubernetes, while the Elastic stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) offers comprehensive logging solutions that excel in data visualization and analysis. ese tools are rst integrated at the collaboration point of the platform and then extend through webhooks into the deployment targets. Building these tools into the overall platform provides the ability to store data within a stable framework and monitor ongoing activities.

## <span id="page-117-7"></span><span id="page-117-1"></span>Orchestration observability

<span id="page-117-5"></span>Orchestration observability comprises four key pillars: metrics, logs, traces, and measurements. You should remember that orchestration denotes an action while observability denotes a measurement. When discussing orchestration observability, we are talking about using orchestration actions to create a foundation for useful metrics. Useful to remember here is that observability is the nal step of the observation process. e rst element is deciding on points to observe, making the desired data observable, and then creating observability to report that data through the appropriate metrics.

Kubernetes observation can be based on several key areas: cluster and Pod monitoring, Deployment and Ingress metrics, persistent storage, and control plane metrics. Platform architecture establishes a Kubernetes baseline within the collaboration and deployment targets, so cluster monitoring ensures those nodes are functioning effectively. is helps determine how the applications are running within the node and the resources used overall. Cluster monitoring ties into Pod monitoring, ensuring not only that the entire cluster functions but also that each application functions.

e next element of Kubernetes observation to consider is a tool such as Prometheus, which can be used to monitor active Kubernetes Deployments. Common metrics are compute utilization through the CPU and the overall Kubernetes state and memory. Establishing a Prometheus server creates a data model based on key-value pairs to enable query language, scrape targets for service discovery, and integrate modular components.

In establishing a Prometheus architecture, there are several basic steps.

e rst steps are to pull data from the Kubernetes API (1), microservice autodiscovery (2a), or directly from Kubernetes nodes into the Prometheus server (2b). e Prometheus server then forwards information to an alert manager and visualization dashboard (3 and 4). e alert manager can then individually notify users (5) through asynchronous messages. e following architecture shows how different data can be incorporated (Figure 4.8):

![](_page_118_Figure_4.jpeg)

<span id="page-118-1"></span><span id="page-118-0"></span>Figure 4.8: Sample Prometheus architecture

is diagram shows how an effective tool can convert data from existing linked discovery into the Kubernetes orchestration, incorporate autodiscovery such as Fluentd, and push alerts and visualization. Another common tool for autodiscovery is OTel. Grafana is oen used to display metrics. e visualization of metrics creates the desired observability for the overall architecture and applications. Further reading on Prometheus and specic implementations is available at <https://prometheus.io/>.

ese tools are just part of the solution as full capability depends on having effective CI/CD processes aligned with your DevOps culture.

## <span id="page-119-4"></span><span id="page-119-0"></span>Platform software delivery ecosystems

<span id="page-119-2"></span>e last step in our essential ecosystem for Platform Engineering incorporates pipelines to deliver soware. Delivering soware involves moving from a coded idea to where customers can interact with delivered soware. Pipelines are the step-by-step directions to build code and then allow deployment. e standard approach involves creating tasks, which are grouped into jobs, which are then grouped into stages within the pipeline. Passing each stage of the pipeline allows the code to progress to the next stage and then deploy. Each task produces artifacts that are observable to quickly detect any bugs or defects within those pipelines. is helps clarify when a merge has been successful and when additional coding may be required. Incorporating effective tools into the platform ecosystem focuses on three knowledge areas: establishing CI/CD tools, integrating DevOps practices, and observing pipelines.

## <span id="page-119-5"></span><span id="page-119-1"></span>CI/CD tools

<span id="page-119-3"></span>e rst step in understanding a CI/CD tool ecosystem is understanding that all vendors aim to make sticky options. ese sticky options ensure that once development begins, user options are limited to remaining on the current tool, enabling continuing revenue for these tools. Despite tools ranging from open source to premium options, the more connected options a CI/CD solution can offer, the better chance for return usage. Even with that understanding, there are some exceptional tools that enable delivering CI/CD solutions. e top candidates within the ecosystem are Jenkins, GitLab, and CircleCI. ese tools are followed by less comprehensive but still manageable tools, such as Bitbucket, Spinnaker, Argo CD, and Harness. e most common distinction between these tools is how much CI/CD each offers as a part of an integrated platform. You can see this distinction in that GitLab offers a full DevOps platform, while Jenkins creates a dedicated automation server. en, there are extended options, such as Azure Pipelines, which is capable of using AWS CI/CD elements to supplement the internal pipelines.

A 2023 CI tool survey [\(https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2022/team-tools/#do-you-use](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2022/team-tools/#do-you-use-any-of-the-following-tools-in-the-cloud-)any-of-the-following-tools-in-the-cloud-) shows that most organizations use Jenkins (47%), GitHub Actions (27%), GitLab CI (27%), and Azure DevOps (13%). While the survey focused on tool usage, factors for selecting the right tool included development workows, usability, pipeline conguration and feedback, scalability, and security. Factors associated with but external to the tool included selecting for cost efficiency and hosting model. Some of these elements (development workow, usability, scalability, security, and cost) were previously discussed as part of the platform ecosystem, and handling those issues concurrently provides a benet to the core platform. is leaves the core element as selecting an appropriate tool within the platform as the conguration.

e rst part of a pipeline addresses how the initial pipeline is congured. Some code uses direct code as YAML les, which could include a variety of approaches from Terraform or Helm charts. YAML has become one of the most common approaches. Even tools that offer Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to create pipelines then translate into some form of YAML. Working directly from coding languages can offer options to rewrite pipelines quicker, but again, many processes are shortened through the GUIs. For instance, GitLab separates pipelines into jobs as individual instructions, runners that execute jobs, and stages that combine different jobs (Figure 4.9).

![](_page_120_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-120-1"></span>Figure 4.9: Sample pipeline for GitLab

Jenkins offers stages along the top of its display but presents jobs on a different window. e Jenkins visualization compares the number of times each stage was run and the time it took for each stage. Both GitLab and Jenkins applications call jobs from the individual elements within the pipeline stages. Executing jobs leads to the next element of workow conguration. Many of the differences in the various ecosystem tools are more about style than substance. e best way to get familiar with them is to try the different options. e underlying functionality remains similar. e challenge then becomes how you align different teams if they are each using different tools. Platforms provide opinionated decisions and allow tailored training to ensure all employees meet the same standards. Some of these initial standards are addressed by how the DevOps culture handles the delivery process.

## <span id="page-120-4"></span><span id="page-120-2"></span><span id="page-120-0"></span>DevOps integration

DevOps involves ow, feedback, and improvement, and these are strongly reected within the CI/CD environment and the chosen pipelines. Using known DevOps best practices shows all pipelines should be structured into the following four areas:

- <span id="page-120-3"></span>Develop: Initial code push. Moves code from the source repository into the pipeline and conducts static tests to ensure basic formatting and language errors are removed. Potential artifacts include code les and review logs.
- Build: Uses the code le to build into integrated source code, making changes to the baseline and again verifying through static testing that new code elements continue to work and variables remain consistent. Potential artifacts include integrated code les, review logs, and version control.

- <span id="page-121-0"></span>Test: Runs integrated code against a number of tests, such as functional, system, or unit, to reveal any errors in execution. is can include security tests. Moves the code from a static element into a completed application. Potential artifacts include test reports, vulnerability analysis, Soware Bill of Materials (SBOM), and code les.
- Deploy: Deploys the nal version to production. Ensures completed soware matches the selected environments. Potential artifacts include working applications and production logs.

Each stage has a specic role that is characterized by the dened artifacts. When matching the desired CI/CD strategy to a DevOps framework, the goal should be identifying the tasks and jobs needed to complete each stage. Identifying those elements helps you select the artifacts needed. As an example, the level of security artifacts needed can vary greatly between different use cases. A retail store might only run vulnerabilities aer deploying code for real-time changes, while a nancial institution might be more concerned with underlying gaps. e artifacts allow you to make detailed decisions about pipeline stages.

One common DevOps concern is whether all code items need to pass all pipeline stages. In some instances, the code is deployed to a test instance for user acceptance or other factors. at test instance may not require the fully detailed tests desired if an application is moving directly to a production environment. Selecting tasks and jobs within stages allows you to comment out, or turn off, pipeline tasks at any stage. e nal artifacts should reect the unsupported areas. If you make the assumption that any pipeline passes all implemented functions, it can still lead to errors later. e platform's strength is in delegating those decisions about pipeline task requirement to the admin level, rather than allowing the user to graduate poor applications. is helps to improve the overall quality.

Another benet of platform DevOps is the ability to create multiple pipelines within set repositories. is means that while the user may not be able to turn off pipeline elements, they can start by selecting a pipeline with fewer elements. is allows code to be built to different completion levels. It also aids in upskilling individuals by gradually using more advanced pipelines. An example might be a coding element passed between one dev team and another to execute a specic function. Security, functional, and smoke tests might be a step too far for those early stages, leading to a specic dev pipeline for that one team. Having a centralized template allows the organization to more thoroughly understand how, and why, which code passes which pipelines.

While emphasizing artifacts, you can sometimes lose track of why those artifacts are important. e artifacts within the pipeline allow for comparison between different pipelines, and different results from the same pipeline. If the security scanner or SBOM tool is always the same, reverting to the platform standard, the different results can be compared through a diff tool (a difference checker) to quickly spot the changes between items. In security results, some vulnerabilities might be just manual, such as having a backup power supply, so elements within the pipeline can be grayed out or turned off so those vulnerabilities do not appear. Making these changes at a platform pipeline level then

<span id="page-122-3"></span>automatically adjusts the artifacts and prevents users from chasing errors that cannot be xed with code. is leads then to the nal element of being able to observe the pipeline effectively.

## <span id="page-122-6"></span><span id="page-122-0"></span>Pipeline observability

<span id="page-122-4"></span>In our opinion, pipelines are one of the most overused and least understood concepts within modern soware development. Pipelines depict the processing element chain, with each output contributing to the following input. Pipelines begin with the previous CI/CD elements, but a well-built soware pipeline adds factors for monitoring and operations. e challenge becomes ensuring you differentiate between the soware pipeline as a conceptual tool and aspects of those pipelines as soware tools. In managing observability within the platform ecosystem, the pipeline should be treated like the soware approaches to create functional code.

<span id="page-122-2"></span>Pipeline observability depends on being able to collect, process, and route logs from the pipeline process to any other location that is owned and managed. Here, the observability comes from compiling the artifacts associated with the pipeline stages. Where the artifacts arrive depends on the early choices you make about the pipeline. One of the primary goals here is using a diff tool to distinguish between various elements. Diff tools come in different formats and languages but compare the output from one section to another. Comparing changes between different builds allows feedback and continuous improvement to be key DevOps parts of the essential platform ecosystem.

As we close this section, one of our favorite stories about pipelines comes to mind. A development team we were working with had recently been introduced to DevSecOps. ey called us and informed us that all their security issues had been solved, the new feature was integrated into the pipeline, and the product was secure. We asked to see the security log results and received a blank look. Rather than creating security logs, the security tool within the pipeline was set to "true," meaning the only requirement was for the security scanner to run. is, obviously, is not the goal for secure soware development. Platforms help create opinionated pipelines, so the needed artifacts are always created, rather than leaving those decisions to developers. With the team, we adjusted the pipeline, set up a diff tool, and were clearly able to demonstrate the risk changes between one version and the next. Consolidating these issues and knowing the needed parts helps bring the platform ecosystem from an initial design to a workable infrastructure.

#### <span id="page-122-7"></span><span id="page-122-5"></span><span id="page-122-1"></span>Summary

is chapter started by introducing the concept of a platform ecosystem, with a platform being more than a single tool but rather the interaction of multiple tools working together. We discussed establishing IaC for the basic platform tools and then using conguration as code to establish working areas. Choosing options early may cause an initial training burden but this is made up for by the time gained in delivering working applications.

We next focused on those working applications by looking at how you orchestrate the platform environment. is section built an understanding of how different systems can be congured for different elements as you move from the core platform cluster to the deployment targets, and containers within those targets. Multiple options were considered but the preferred approach for this book remains working in Kubernetes to deliver efficient tools. While Kubernetes is not always the most effective as an out-of-the-box solution, it offers sufficient power at the platform level to make the needed changes.

Lastly, we discussed the importance of CI/CD systems as the end element of the platform ecosystem. All applications must pass through pipelines, so having the right tool is important. Tools such as GitLab, Circle CI, and Jenkins were all considered, but the best solution will be the one that is right for your team. e next chapter moves beyond these initial solutions to discuss how AI-generated solutions can help expedite the build and deploy phases associated with your platform.

#### CALL TO ACTION

- Determine the right IaC/configuration as code integration to support the platform's architecture and requirements.
- Implement monitoring solutions and confirm data arrives at the right elements for action.
- Confirm the CI/CD tools generate the right artifacts for continuous observability.

# <span id="page-163-6"></span><span id="page-163-2"></span>Data as a strategic asset

Data is a strategic asset that drives business value when aligned with business goals, utilizing AI and fostering a data-driven culture. is strategic impact empowers companies to make informed

decisions, innovate, and stay competitive. Exploring data architecture and DataOps within Platform Engineering provides practical insights and real-world examples of the transformative impact of effective data management and advanced analytics. Mastering data in Platform Engineering requires continuous learning, adaptation, and a commitment to excellence. In the following section, we will examine how a robust and carefully planned data architecture can improve Platform Engineering to expedite the delivery of business value.

# <span id="page-164-4"></span><span id="page-164-0"></span>Data architecture in Platform Engineering

<span id="page-164-2"></span>Architecture should always design the form for distributing data within a platform. One should return to early evaluations of Conway's Law, ensuring the designed structure remains supportable by the broader organization. Data must ow through architecture in a manner the company can use and understand. e rst step is designing a reliable, scalable architecture. is allows identifying key components and best practices for your platform data management. Once data is streaming, steps should ensure quality data, governance practices, and security. Finally, this section concludes with some examples of tools, especially in generative AI, that can assist in data solutions. For specic architectural patterns, reference [Chapter](#page-55-0) 2.

Similar to any other aspect of the platform, data management requires a sound architecture to demonstrate a path. Data architectures consider data at rest and data in motion as well as transitions between those states. e more advanced architectures consider data not just as a single element but as a myriad of potential feeds and reports. Integrating all those elements in the modern IoT world requires careful planning.

## <span id="page-164-5"></span><span id="page-164-1"></span>Data architecture design

<span id="page-164-3"></span>Designing a reliable and scalable architecture focuses on those two key components. Reliability is what ensures the platform soundness between data users, data providers, and platform teams. ose reliable discussions should focus on agreements between the different stakeholders, which are usually conrmed through the establishment of clear SLAs demonstrating a level of reliability. ese measures can include technical specications such as update rates, downtime, throughput, packet sizes, and encryption standards. Each agreement contributes to making the platform data more accessible at a higher rate than other alternatives. Contributing to reliability can address transmitted data accuracy, how closely data matches original sources, and at what point data changes or the extension of those data points occurs.

When examining reliable big data platforms with the 5 Vs (velocity, volume, value, variety, and veracity), you have to ensure not only transmission but that accurate data reaches the user. e following list highlights some characteristics of each of those big data components:

- Velocity: How quickly data is created within a system and how fast that created data moves to the next element. For example, traffic cameras record all events at a set location but may not instantly pass that data to a reporting element.
- Volume: e amount of data generated from multiple sources, including social media, commercial transactions, and user interfaces. Large data volumes allow high-level analysis to reveal patterns that may not be apparent in small data sets.
- Value: How much impact each element of data has on a company's business. Most big data value comes from the ability to achieve pattern recognition to generate insights to improve performance, operations, and other quantiable benets.
- Variety: How many different types of data are collected within a system. Modern systems collect text-based inputs, streaming video, and other factors. Data can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. Data management tools must be able to handle multiple types of data within common dashboards and visualizations.
- <span id="page-165-2"></span>Veracity: Quality and accuracy of collected data. Data oen contains errors, inconsistency, and other uncertainty from multiple sources. As an example, errors can occur in addresses, names, or other information tied to an individual. You might see an address with transposed street numbers, misspelled avenue names, or other bad inputs.

Data that meets these 5 Vs can be challenging to handle from a reliability standpoint. e impacts on collected data within the platform can impact velocity, volume, and veracity frequently. If a platform supports multiple users on the same application with teams deploying multiple times per day, the velocity is impacted. When you add the operational management of those systems, the user volume across development and operational aspects can drive challenging alignment. Finally, the data veracity might be challenged by having multiple versions running, different test measurements, and then the operational data. One way to manage big data consists of implementing scalable solutions.

Scalability forms the other data architecture component for platforms. Once you achieve initial reliability, measures should be introduced for scalability. Scalability enhances reliability by offering additional options. When the platform scales, options are introduced to manage data through other formats. One common example involves structuring data ows to have earlier stopping points before the data hits the full system. Testing scenarios on the platform can use captured data representative of the true data without streaming access. One example is a healthcare system that manages user requests, safeguards case management data, and provides clinical services, all subject to personal identiable information (PII) and healthcare-restricted data. A scalable test solution could segment the data and prevent critical data from reaching other data stores.

# <span id="page-165-6"></span><span id="page-165-4"></span><span id="page-165-0"></span>Modeling data management

<span id="page-165-5"></span><span id="page-165-3"></span><span id="page-165-1"></span>Modeling a reliable and scalable architecture might involve using a modeling language such as the Unied Modeling Language (UML). UML serves as a general-purpose modeling tool published by the Object Management Group in 2005 and later published as an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard. ese standards break every item into an object with attachments,

associated by class and arranged into components. ese groupings then represent functions within the architecture diagram. Items within UML are related by association, inheritance, and aggregation. As a simple example, all medical records for a particular clinic might be associated and inherited by the broader insurance, while all instances for a particular individual or medical case might be aggregated. e following image depicts an architecture for data entry within UML.

![](_page_166_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-166-0"></span>Figure 6.1: UML example of a data conversion architecture

e diagram displays how entry and search can be aligned into a common schema. Most tools provide an option to convert designed architecture into additional formats. e challenge can be ensuring the right key pairs are presented in the correct manner. As an example, Keycloak allows bringing user groups from one database to another, updating users from previous SSO solutions to a new one. However, during the conversion, Keycloak frequently adds a backslash to the user group's name. is prevents them from reaching the same areas although transferred users may still use Keycloak. is type of conversion error reinforces the name for a clear schema and conversion in data management.

Another modeling option involves e Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). TOGAF was rst introduced in 1995 as part of a US Department of Defense project. e language was intended to address four goals:

- Improving return on investment
- Using more cost-effective resources
- Avoiding vendor lock-in
- Establishing a common language

Like UML, the language is relatively simple to use but additional certications are possible. TOGAF uses three pillars of continuum tracking, an architectural development model, and enterprise

architecture domains. e following gure demonstrates how TOGAF might show interactions within a data format:

![](_page_167_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-167-0"></span>Figure 6.2: TOGAF architecture model

You can see how the system of interest, the platform, shows the architecture while linking with stakeholders at multiple points. ese connections demonstrate which areas exhibit control over which factors in moving the design forward. e most important thing in Platform Engineering is the capacity to use the domains of business, data, applications, and technical architecture to diagram needs. TOGAF excels at modeling ow between the domains, making it a natural t for some data concerns.

One other key to TOGAF is that every element within the architecture has four aspects:

- Active: Every time the data is received, an action must occur.
- Passive: Data is collected and held until an outside call to action is received.
- Behavior: e data, when collected, moves to a certain store point or repository.
- Motivation: Data objects are assigned a motivation for when they must shi from active to passive or exhibit a motivation.

e weakness of using TOGAF is that it requires much more depth than UML to develop a comprehensive architecture. is can work well if you have a lot of time, but it can be challenging with rapid projects. One suggestion is to begin with UML modeling structures and expand into the more complete TOGAF model as more data is collected.

## <span id="page-168-2"></span><span id="page-168-0"></span>Data architecture best practices

<span id="page-168-1"></span>When considering some best practices, you should return to Conway, ensuring modeling mirrors business practices, and the proposed structure does not run counter to existing pathways. If the pathways diverge too much, even excellent data may be unavailable to individuals within the platform. Data architecture should strive to identify key areas for documentation and quality, performance monitoring, testing, and scalability.

Best practices start with how one documents the data architecture. e previous sections mentioned using formats such as UML or TOGAF, but this extends into clear terminology with visual representations. For example, if there is a date or time format, all entries should be in a common standard. If one set of data uses the MM/DD/YYYY (02/10/2012) structure and another uses the DD, Mon, Year (10 Feb 2012) structure, there may be difficulty in aligning records. Each format selected within the schema should be built on a clear rationale for why a particular scheme has been collected. is can range from a declared status, such as a date, to ingestion from other components that have set sales standards and inventory numbers.

e next area builds from initial documentation to creating quality data. Just as the standards for the initial data are set, those quality standards should live in the same documentation. e quick list to ensure quality data is that all data is complete, unique, timely, valid, accurate, and consistent. Quality in the platform might be veried users, links to testing structure, or comparison against the existing database to prevent duplication. When using the platform, you can allow guest users but not want those users to submit merge tickets during applications. At the same time, guest users might be allowed to develop without limits, but not move data into a testing environment. Qualifying data originators and verication during quality validation can help prevent erroneous data from reaching production.

Data versioning occurs in multiple areas. Data can be restricted to specic collection sets, evaluated as a time series in multiple sets, or distinguished by sensors. Multiple paths are usually assessed to determine the best data versioning for a specic implementation. Most platform data implementations prefer using a streaming approach with a constant data ow, so new data, once quality-checked, will become part of the overall stream. Using separate data versions is most appropriate during the initial stages of determining an initial dataset, test set, and then the production data for ML. Different sets can be used to periodically check the ML model for errors in quality, regression, or bias.

Our third best practice area involves performance monitoring. Effective monitoring follows best practices for observability in establishing clear objectives, automating data collection, creating scalability, and using alerting to notify exceptions. Clear objectives require clear metrics, such as the amount of data in throughput, required elds, and veried users. Required elds might be only the key ID eld, or extend to other items such as prices, inventory numbers, and stocking rates. e required elds should always be inputted and allow for the extension of submitted data but not the alteration of existing elements. ese rst elds allow scalability because data can be either the lowest compute drain or one of the highest depending on the required validity. For example, if the primary data source archives video clips and every clip must be run to verify if an AI submission occurs, those checks can be difficult. Verifying data against an existing inventory for duplicate entries is much easier.

Moving on from monitoring should address how you test data during the initial ingestion and when data is stored in the platform. Not all data remains consistent all the time, and the system should test to ensure data meets new specications. An easy check for data testing within platforms is to call only the latest data. e following example shows some initial code that may address calling only data within a specic timeframe from a SQL database:

```
with data
      as (select *,row_number() over(partition by subject order by createddatetime) as
rnk from t
               )
        ,cte
       as(select id,subject,createddatetime as begin_date, createddatetime,cast(1 as
int) as grp from data
          where rnk=1
          union all
        select b.id
               ,b.subject
              ,b.createddatetime
              ,case when datediff(minute,a.createddatetime,b.createddatetime) > 5 then
b.createddatetime
              else
               a.createddatetime
               end as createddatetime
           ,case when datediff(minute,a.createddatetime,b.createddatetime) > 5 then
a.grp+1
               else
             A.grp
            end as grp
       from cte a
       join t b
           on a.id+1=b.id
          and a.subject=b.subject
          )
 select * from cte order by 1
```

is code looks at all data in the platform and creates groups for each subject where the data is published within 5 minutes. Different groups are created by subject, so A entries are grouped in one set, and B entries in another. ese differentiators can be easily integrated and extended into a variety of coding tools and APIs.

More testing formats are covered extensively in [Chapter](#page-213-0) 9. ere are some unique areas for testing that are specic to data. Data testing typically involves three separate types within a production instance. ese tests are designed to measure whether the desired data inputs through an application correctly and are described as follows:

- Standard test: An expected input gives an expected output. If you enter a username and password, you expect to either enter the application or be informed the username does not exist.
- Boundary test: ese tests form edge cases for multiple events. An example from the previous paragraphs is entering data in a nonstandard format and the application rejecting the data.
- Erroneous test: e opposite of the standard test, these tests require the application to notify when bad data has been entered. One example is putting in inventory numbers in a non-standard format, or an inventory number that does not exist.

<span id="page-170-1"></span>Data testing should look for some very specic database items. A shortlist includes data schema, table structure, columns, key IDs, stored macros within the elements, server validation, and data duplication. One frequent need for evaluating macros is a format called SQL injection, where code can be entered within the database, and when the form runs, the code is executed. ese malicious code items can delete other data elements, ruin formats, and make it a very difficult day for developers. A suggestion when using data in tests is to employ soware to generate fake tables from a known schema. is ensures testing processes are validated but do not break actual data. Many AI/ML processes are fairly efficient at generating large, alternative databases for testing. Similar to the versioning approach, metadata catalogs can be used to compare various sets. e metadata ensures the data catalogs measure similar features and provide comparison elements. Effective catalogs also allow scalability and comparison between elements.

e nal best practice for data architecture is to ensure scalability. is seems an easy approach: ensuring enough compute and storage exist to manage the database. Other issues might address the number of users, consecutive use, and the SOLID principles addressed in [Chapter](#page-55-0) 2. One example of scalability might be limiting an order number, or inventory number to a set number of characters. When the business expands past that initial limit or additional features are required, adjusting those factors to scale might require a full database revision. For example, if an inventory number is set for nine numbers, with a dash between characters four and ve, the later addition of a three-digit code to the end might be difficult. You can always add additional columns, but that again causes a full database revision. ese best practices in architecture are linked to being able to conduct effective DataOps within your platform.

# <span id="page-170-2"></span><span id="page-170-0"></span>DataOps – Streamlining data management and operations

<span id="page-171-3"></span><span id="page-171-2"></span>DataOps integrates DevOps best practices with ow, feedback, and improvements to data engineering practices. As DevOps primarily focuses on delivering products, DataOps can oen be a subset of overall business strategies, required in production but falling behind during development and test phases. Incorporating data management to test functions early ensures the best data becomes available to support analytics, ML, and continuous improvement models. Much like other areas, building effective DataOps concentrates on key areas such as collaboration, automation, and observability.

# <span id="page-171-6"></span><span id="page-171-0"></span>The importance of DataOps

<span id="page-171-5"></span>When starting a DataOps journey, many of the best practices are common with the best practices in areas such as MLOps, DevOps, AIOps, FinOps, or any other construction of the operational mindset. Every operational journey should start with dened objectives, cross-functional teams, a commitment to automation, and observability. ese factors are supplemented with data-focused language such as automating data pipelines, controlling data versions, emphasizing quality, and maintaining data security, especially with more sensitive data volumes.

You can dene objectives for DataOps similar to any other operational factor. In [Chapter](#page-213-0) 9, we take a detailed look at constructing metrics and service-level agreements to support various operations. For data, the best look measures those items against testing for standard, boundary, and erroneous use cases. You should ensure that users can reach the data, that the data meets quality standards, and that applications continue to function. Cross-functional teams then use the data to ensure success. In this case, cross-functional means including developers, database engineers, and analysts within the same spectrum. In the interest of maintaining small teams, these database specialists are oen considered a support team, available for questions and support applications but not development team members. As platforms expand, the associated databases oen expand.

One element to consider when launching a platform is whether you intend to manage the data or allow users to manage data as needed for applications. Some constructions manage every development aspect, while others use third-party soware. ere are some standard database tools that add options for better operations and management such as Oracle Database, MongoDB, Amazon RDS or Dynamo DB, SAP SE, or Snowake. Each has different strengths and weaknesses depending on your database needs. One frequent requirement is automation in operations.

# <span id="page-171-7"></span><span id="page-171-1"></span>Database pipelines

<span id="page-171-4"></span>Database pipelines should be constructed in a DevOps manner to ingest new data. Depending on your platform use case, you might need to handle streaming data, automated entries from a retail web service, or some other format. Just as application pipelines have stages, so too do automated data pipelines, and they are as follows:

- Data ingestion: Initial gathering from databases, microservice, APIs, and applications.
- Data processing: Cleaning, verifying, converting, and enriching data while ensuring it meets quality standards.
- Data storage: e process of storing data within a database, data warehouse, data lake, or other schema to make it readily accessible at the needed time.
- Data analysis: Evaluating data to determine trends across large ingestion elements, especially when considering big data input.
- <span id="page-172-3"></span>Data visualization: Converting ingested data into easily visualized formats to allow users to observe activity, activate alert notications, and address emerging needs.

<span id="page-172-4"></span>Data pipelines handle data in either batch or real-time processes. In batch processes, data is stored until a certain point, either time or size, and then processed. In real-time processes, all data is immediately ingested into the database. In either case, two formats are typically used, extracttransform-load (ETL) or extract-load-transform (ELT). e difference between the two is whether the transformation occurs in the primary database, or before it gets there. If there are multiple developers on a platform, it may be easier to use ETL format.

You can use pipeline elements to continuously monitor data dri and distribution changes. ese changes can impact downstream ML models or analytics dashboards. For example, if you are monitoring power usage in an urban environment, unusual weather patterns can inuence data. If you are using a time regression model comparing baselines from one seasonal average to the next, the inuence of an event can alternate baselines. is may result in changes for preventative maintenance, or scalability within the platform. When dealing with a cold front, the analytics dashboard might show a signicant increase in power usage but not one that would be repeated in previous seasons or years. Once you ingest data, it is time to consider security and observability for that data.

# <span id="page-172-5"></span><span id="page-172-1"></span><span id="page-172-0"></span>Data security and observability

<span id="page-172-2"></span>Data security and observability mirror solutions that have been presented in later chapters to maximize platform performance. Security is a must for data but should be considered within the overall platform format. Implementing encryption and SSO techniques ensures that data remains protected within the platform security architecture. e biggest challenge emerges when you input data from external sources. e previous section briey mentioned this with the ETL approach, ensuring that data meets quality standards before bringing those elements into your system. Addressing quality early stops the easiest failures, such as preventing SQL injection, and then allows delivering quality solutions.

e next step for security should be considering what happens if corrupted data does enter the system. You should always maintain an ability to recover previous data models from hot, warm, or cold storage. is can be challenging for businesses that depend on real-time communication. For example, in the e-retail industry, losing 30 minutes of customer data aer launching a sale can be devastating. In addition to losing sales, customers can be unhappy at having to resubmit data, and inventory stocks might prevent order fulllment.

Observability for DataOps occurs in two ways. Just like security is designed to signal and guard, observability for data should be the same. e signal standard noties when new data is ingested, or data does not meet quality standards. e guard element prevents and noties when bad data attempts to enter the platform. Most database management tools provide a path to observe data. ese tools can be combined with the observability standards introduced in [Chapter](#page-213-0) 9.

# <span id="page-173-1"></span><span id="page-173-0"></span>Summary

is chapter launched from the previous usage of generative AI tools to expand into using that data once it hits the platform. is begins by recognizing the importance of data within the platform. While the platform's basics solve many issues, these issues are frequently impotent until data has been added. Adding data means constructing an effective strategy to consume and manage data within various formats. Effective strategies demonstrated how to maximize value for the business, and we presented several case studies where businesses converted sound practices into actual dollars.

Once a strategy is in place, you must develop an architecture supporting those practices. e chapter demonstrated building an architecture, introduced several modeling languages, and suggested management techniques. Implementing sound data practices at the platform's early stages support DataOps management, working with data at rest and data in motion throughout the platform. e next chapter takes these initial platform stages and begins applying security, compliance, and risk management techniques to make your platform secure and reliable.

#### CALL TO ACTION

- Understand the data needed for platform success and implement a strategy.
- Design an architecture supporting your organization and platform.
- Apply sound operational techniques to ingest and manage data during daily operations.

<span id="page-174-4"></span>DevOps oen appears as DevSecOps to emphasize security, but any operational solution requires security. Building a platform focuses on delivering value, allowing others to develop, and securing from end to end. Platforms provide the opportunity to provide secure by default solutions with details like vulnerability tracking, soware bill of materials, and patching solutions before soware ever reaches the customer. Comprehensive security and risk management solutions also manage those who connect to platforms, especially in PaaS and SaaS solutions. To further expedite delivery, AI tools can inuence security outcomes, prevent inevitable manual failures, and support full-spectrum risk solutions.

e question regarding computers and soware development frequently requires providing a secure offering. e most secure systems are those with no connections. However, while hardware in a vault may be virtually inaccessible, it also serves no purpose. Having functional and valuable soware means having connections, and those links create risk. is chapter is not about pipelines or CI/CD but about making the platform to support those eventual actions.

In this chapter, we return to security basics to create the basics for platforms as secure by default and manage any extraneous risk. e following topics are covered:

- Designing a secure-by-default platform
- Network management and security practices
- Leveraging AI for security enhancements

## <span id="page-174-7"></span><span id="page-174-2"></span>Technical requirements

ere are no specic technical requirements for this section. A basic understanding of architectural concepts, security scanners, and identity and access management (IDAM) will be helpful.

## <span id="page-174-8"></span><span id="page-174-3"></span>Designing a secure-by-default platform

<span id="page-174-5"></span>Designing a secure platform starts with the idea that securing the platform considers internal and external threats. Security starts with two basic ideas, all security tools exist to either signal an alert that something is happening or guard against an event. Sometimes, one combines guarding and signaling in that there is an alert, and then the protection goes into place. e idea is similar to a bank vault receiving an alert and the big bars slamming across the vault area.

is thought then becomes the platform ideation. Ideation, as a concept, considers further formulating a thought or idea. Everyone today seeks secure soware development with DevSecOps and Agile practices all shiing le. Despite shiing le, security remains bolted on to processes rather than integral to delivery, and no exchange exists to moderate values between functional and secure within application development.

Platforms integrate the idea that individuals experience security practices, move on to dene guidelines for creating secure work, and then mix the two concepts to establish a platform as secure by default. When developing platform security, needed security functions are not bolted on but instead form initial core design. Program managers distinguish between security and functionality . Security are aspects adding to compliance, access, authorization, or regulatory requirements while function criteria are more tightly tied to what a program does. From the developer's perspective, all functions are functions; they merely accomplish different ends. Shiing le as a security function appears in [Chapter](#page-33-0) 1 as a basic concept of Platform Engineering

e platform security model relies on functions featuring external observability, internal integration, and end-user implementation perspectives. Security scans and dashboards should be integral to executed processes without thinking about the task. e question should never be if the scan ran, but which scan was run and how the results were displayed. Just like with early architecture requirements, security begins with questions about what to secure, how to secure it, and then is there security (i.e., demonstrating that security exists). Asking these questions begins the meta-approach to integrate the platform's multiple tasks into a common security framework. is common integration supports the soware value chain. It is not enough to secure the initial login, one le within a framework, or a single vulnerability. Comprehensive platform security addresses all issues by creating the fence, adding a gate, and then putting bells on the swinging door.

All security practices should start as part of Agile soware development. Above, we referenced developers see no difference between development, operational, and security functions. All items are simply a function with a specic set of results. When building a secure-by-default platform, part of the question should be how much security will be needed. Security experts will expound that more security is always needed, but sometimes the security resides in the basics or the Layer 8 humans rather than integrating another tool. Layer 8 humans refers to the seven-layer OSI model with the humorous approach that humans interacting with the system are level 8.e rst step in any value chain is to assess how value affects overall objectives to create protable products and services. Security perspectives can shi radically depending on an individual's perceptions about objectives. ese shis require a broad introduction to understand how thinking about security experiences claries understanding of platforms.

Too much security can be as harmful as too little security, posing a risk to the number of users rather than active users. e wrong types of security, and adding dynamic tools to an internal database can add cost and slow performance. e inability to create observability within security tools might catch an issue but prevent resolution. e ideas behind security are as important as the actual implementation. ese initial areas decompose into people, processes, and technology across the team, organization, and enterprise levels. Each offers solutions that affect platform outcomes.

# <span id="page-176-6"></span><span id="page-176-0"></span>Basics of security ideation

<span id="page-176-4"></span><span id="page-176-3"></span>inking about thinking is a meta-concept best understood by applying a phenomenological outlook. e concept of modern phenomenology, as a philosophical practice, originated with Descartes as a follow-on from the Socratic method. Phenomenology suggests that all aspects center on the thing itself. ings, in this case, security, are inuenced by creation, observation, and experience to create a layered understanding. Creation for the platform occurs through shared development, observation from internal and external users, and the security experience as the platform combines functions.

Phenomenological thought suggests all experiences, and one's experience of those things, including concepts, begins with the process observer. Only by understanding the observer's perspective can one build understanding. e three core aspects of understanding are the presence and absence of the thing, identity as manifold through the expression and expressed artifacts, and clarifying parts versus wholes during the experience. Phenomenology does not create new understanding, rather it attempts to clarify the existing experience as understanding.

<span id="page-176-5"></span><span id="page-176-2"></span><span id="page-176-1"></span>While esoteric, these terms readily apply to platform security. In presence and absence, one assesses how security relates between different elements within the collaboration or deployment targets. e root cause for identity in the experience reects the need for Single Sign On (SSO), identity management tools, and the roles expressed as part of the Role-based Access Controls (RBAC) or Attribute-based Access Controls (ABAC) controls. e last element, parts versus wholes, is crucial in platform security. One can secure a single tool or multiple tools, to change platform levels within various applications. ink about a net of overlapping circles, each protecting a particular area, and requiring control elements when one passes across a line. Figure 7.1 shows how confusing those security perspectives might be when looking from a top level.

![](_page_177_Figure_0.jpeg)

<span id="page-177-1"></span><span id="page-177-0"></span>Figure 7.1 – Security control zones: Theoretical

Each circle represents a potentially different security consideration for a different area. Users tend to start with external access and move to internal, lateral accesses as moving across the environment. At the far end, customers also have external access to production elements. Starting from the le, the initial access zones need user and password security, the cluster needs identity and internal data protection, monitoring tools might need to be separated from the average developer, applications in deployment targets need container-level protection, and then monitoring and protection from the customers who use applications on the net. One common attack method, SQL injection, uses the capability to put certain characters into program inputs to affect program execution. One must block these areas while still allowing creation freedom across the platform. Understanding these areas requires knowing the conceptual security pattern for your platform.

Expanding to conceptual security looks differently at true facts versus assumptions. Conceptual security relates to the experience of "the thing itself " by removing the outside observer's perspective. Descartes used meditations on the thing to connect his faith to the physical. Another philosopher, Edmund Husserl, distinguished between material content and logical generality within the analyzed observations. It does not matter if the outside observer sees a fence or a moat as long as no castle access exists without using the approved gate. ese distinctions carry over into building platform security by identifying what is known to be true, what should be true, and actions taken if the overall elements are false.

Coding allows a much clearer distinction to dene experienced artifacts than philosophy. We suggest these distinctions are valid when assessing security as few distinguish between security concepts and the material representation delivered by development. At a high level, one can quickly think about three common security distinctions: compliance, technical guardrails, and vulnerabilities. Each offers different construction, but the user experiences all as a secure by default platform.

A common example starts with observing the physical rather than the more challenging conceptual understanding. Husserl used the term "eidetic" as essential, so eidetic reduction expands our understanding of the core concept. When one observes a table, it holds multiple physical and conceptual eidetic layers depending on observation. Depending on where one physically observes the table, it may be a rectangle, a rhombus, or even a triangle. Conceptually, a table can be a place to eat, meet, or hold things for later use. Some tables support gaming, puzzles or other purposes. e eidetic understanding might then be that the essence of a table is something to do with the capacity, whether intellectually or physically, that a table holds. e same applies to the security concept: every security artifact must guard or signal, and the challenge remains in creating effective, interlocking artifacts.

#### Security for people, process, and technology

For security, the eidetic ideation would be moving from the essential concrete object or idea to the pure essence derived by reducing the ideas to core components. is ideation applies when looking at security: does it appear as a comfort blanket to reduce risk, a process involving different individuals at different stages, or a technical solution to vulnerabilities and challenges? In a DevOps perspective, one adds observation layers, pipeline artifacts, and external interaction with customers, managers, and product owner. Each area functions as an individual part and an integrated whole through, describing outcomes with eidetic reduction, and demonstrating functionality.

<span id="page-178-1"></span>Security ideation begins with people. One cannot experience, leaving out potential future AI options, without a person to describe the experience. Organizations all acquire people with roles, skills, and talents from multiple areas. An individual's background creates their experiential lens, and those lenses inuence security outcomes. Each individual creates value and an understanding of value through judging security based on an individual perspective.

<span id="page-178-0"></span>To return from the esoteric to the physical, companies oen use red-team assessments to gauge security levels. A red team is a designated group of individuals who attempt to penetrate the security surrounding a platform, a system, or even a building. Many of these red teams start by requiring soware implanted within the platform. en, security areas that might prevent that item from working are disabled. However, this fundamentally changes the experience as that root item would not exist in the initial construct. is thought equates to testing only the front door while ignoring the yard's fence, guard dog, and land mines.

A developer might bring previous security experience with no development, work at a company that experienced multiple breaches, or endless hours chasing vulnerabilities. An Ops person might want to use security to reduce time on call, ease xes, and minimize downtime. A product owner might want to sell more products and build a public image. e customer might want to know if their public data is protected. Each brings ideation, and an area is eidetically reduced to consider part and wholes, identity, and presence or absence before addressing other layers.

<span id="page-179-2"></span>Ideation can be a singular event or the sum of the entire process. e process integrates individual pieces to accomplish end goals. e process takes multiple tasks, creates artifacts representing each, and constructs an understanding about how guarding and signaling must occur. e presence or absence of those artifacts denes how they experience the overall task. e expressed identity reects whether a security scan happened, did the scan was complete, and how patching contributes to the experience.

Further, one must consider whether the security process constitutes a whole experience or merely the parts of the process creating the whole element. In the platform, the security experience should be an integrated part of the whole. Processes can be accelerated or derailed due to the presence of people and technology within the individual elements.

<span id="page-179-3"></span><span id="page-179-1"></span>e nal assessed element, in today's cybersecurity environment, must be the technology to either develop processes or augment people. Technology contains material elements but remains vital to the platform experience. Specic security requirements across on-premise, cloud, or mobile systems can change an individual's interaction with those elements. Later elements within this chapter focus on the technical pieces implemented with the understanding that people and processes can all change the technology. For example, if one leaves their keys hanging in the lock, how secure the door may be never matters.

We oen blame technological failures without fully comprehending the interaction through people and processes. In many ways, DevSecOps, or PaaS, IaaS, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, and Conguration as Code are all previously ideated in a way to shape user interaction. e platform expands this by creating specic ideated platforms with dened experiences required to achieve secure outcomes. e variables remain to see whether those dening terms communicate the experience one has with various tools. In some cases, with some of the more advanced tools and metrics, it may be possible to examine how the technology experiences the user as much as the user experiences the technology. Understanding those experiences guides the next two sections in what must be secured and how to secure those elements.

#### <span id="page-179-4"></span><span id="page-179-0"></span>What to secure

<span id="page-180-0"></span>Aer understanding the conceptual approach, the question for designing our secure by default platform should be: what do I secure within the workspace? e rst area to secure should be external access. Dening external access describes the process that allows transit to the platform and from circle to circle across the security architecture. Each circle appears as a trust circle, those within a circle can make changes, and communicating with other circles requires consensus through technical handshakes. ese accesses are balanced against internal vulnerabilities within the different elements, preventing vulnerabilities from releasing in deployed soware. Finally, one must secure data at rest and data in motion. e ways operational tools conduct business and users manage data all matter to the security outcomes.

#### External access

<span id="page-180-1"></span>External access lies in two spots: accessing the platform initially and traversing across different elements. is access can also extend to dependencies within the programs, later referenced as a Soware Bill of Materials. Initial security determines who can log in to see the platform and decides which areas they can attend. ink of external security as buying a ticket to a carnival; the initial access allows one into the carnival, but the rides and games require different tickets. One can purchase properties at the front gate or as one reaches the required segments.

In implementing the overall architecture, the initial security should be to the primary collaboration platform, creating a user account that can view all potential items but with limited edit properties. Different user roles within RBAC as developer, manager, or admin can limit the ability to reach unique tools or properties within those tools. One should subdivide roles into different elements depending on the type of tool. An initial example oen occurs from the IDE. One might want a developer to be able to create branches, fork repositories, and write code but restrict merge permissions to approved individuals. e same individual may be approved to work within a project but not create new projects. is security creates logging for what has happened and prevents potential errors.

<span id="page-180-2"></span>Traversing across different elements requires exchanging artifacts. e token between one element should empower the second element and allow the exchange of trusted data. Some of these become more of an internal vulnerability, but initial structuring requires architecting which elements each element requires. A typical example is the Soware Bill of Materials (SBOM) that many production elements use. is artifact compiles all the dependencies used by soware, usually in a textual format, but details the specic links used by the soware. ese artifacts include library versions, recent updates, and sometimes the elements required for the soware to be successful. Understanding external vulnerabilities allows conversion to addressing internal vulnerabilities within tools.

#### Internal vulnerabilities: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures and patching

<span id="page-181-2"></span>Internal vulnerabilities are those inherent within any element of soware. ey are not part of the external dependency but elements within the desired soware. ese can be the properties within the soware, such as allowing the creation of other artifacts, the presence of embedded secrets, or errors allowing malicious or misguided conversion. As mentioned above, SQL injection presents a typical example of an internal error with tools, even those integrated into a platform. SQL injection is when some soware treats entries within the program as code, executes commands or allows unintended functions.

One advantage of a platform is that integrating various tools can reduce the potential scope of internal errors. Efficiently setting up the RBAC from the previous element can prevent escalation of privilege between different tools. For example, an error that allows escalation on one tool, from user permissions to administrative permissions within the IDE, would require a different access point to allow similar access within a deployment or management stack. ese internal controls are a best practice between different tools on the platform.

<span id="page-181-0"></span>To ensure the best performance, one should keep up with current Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and required patches. e U.S. government sponsors the CVE library (cve.mitre.org) and uses the Mitre Company to proliferate errors within tools. Anyone can submit a CVE, and most companies respond reasonably quickly to mitigate any identied threats. e recent Solar Winds hack (2023) against the U.S. government was only possible because some customers failed to make required patches to systems (https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/SolarWinds[hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know\).](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/SolarWinds-hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know) e SBOM is the initial guide but platform maintainers should strive to ensure all systems possess the latest updates and patches. From a security perspective, one reason for continuous development is to ensure potential hackers do not have enough time to nd and exploit holes within the soware. None of the best patches can help if the data supporting those applications is not secured.

#### Data

<span id="page-181-1"></span>Securing data falls into two major categories: data at rest and data in motion. Data within the platform should be considered at rest when contained in a deployment target or within a cluster and in motion when moving between clusters or across the network. Despite being in motion between containers, data can be secured within the cluster at rest by establishing shared repositories and databases. Sharing permissions occurs through tokens and RBAC controls, as discussed above. e rationale for sharing the tokens within the cluster is to maximize ease of use for each user and when working with teams between users.

Constructing shared data within clusters does not preclude creating individual data sites. It may be advantageous not to share data between teams or individuals at specic points, even when on shared resources. Implementing RBAC continues to work at those solutions. Implementing effective data security allows the creation of encryption keys associated with the data shared between individuals.

is pattern does open possibilities for malicious insiders, those with permissions on the cluster that take inappropriate actions. Some actions are technical, in locking down different areas and some are policy-based. Technical solutions amount to tighter RBAC controls that can prevent the platform from operating as a DevOps fundamental. e preferred solution for these individuals is a policy one, do not allow individuals who have le the company to have access, and have comprehensive rules for user behavior in place. One of the preferred policies is least privilege, ensuring users never have more access than needed to do their job. en, the policy solutions can be mitigated by technical signaling when bad behavior happens rather than stopping an event that may be good in some contexts.

## <span id="page-182-5"></span><span id="page-182-0"></span>How to secure the platform

<span id="page-182-3"></span><span id="page-182-1"></span>Several standard approaches exist to secure platforms effectively through technical means. e rst approach, as referenced, is to implement SSO tools using proven user directories. Aer that, encryption methods can go a long way towards securing data, preventing password misuse, and protecting code, even in production. Finally, as part of the platform's operational construct and security tools, the implemented gadgets prevent new security problems from reaching the platform or proliferating across the functions. Gadgets include scanners across the platform, monitoring deployed applications, and pipeline tools that prevent errors from reaching production.

#### Single-Sign-On (SSO)

<span id="page-182-4"></span><span id="page-182-2"></span>SSO applications create an authentication method that allows users to access multiple websites with one set of credentials. e converse to this is password managers that require different communication but store all elements in the same place. A sample of the SSO process appears in Figure 7.2.

![](_page_183_Figure_0.jpeg)

<span id="page-183-7"></span><span id="page-183-4"></span>Figure 7.2 – SSO process

Password managers would arrive before the connection began, providing input in stage 4 for the Optional Login. e Identity Provider allows a primary connection or veries more advanced access based on the password. e returned token then tells the service provider what properties to release. ese identity properties oen align with the SSO through an authentication protocol, typically either a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Secure Assertion Markup Language (SAML).

LDAP provides an industry standard to manage directory information. ese functions are frequently separate from establishing a token, but verify a particular login has the permissions to use a token. As a process, a platform can establish an LDAP directory with user names and attributes, and then each user can log in. LDAP can divide into simple authentications, where a correct name and password connect a user, or integrate with a Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL). SASL solutions require authentication before matching users against the overall directory.

<span id="page-183-8"></span><span id="page-183-5"></span><span id="page-183-3"></span><span id="page-183-2"></span><span id="page-183-1"></span><span id="page-183-0"></span>LDAP is widely available, and some top-performing programs are OpenLDAP or Apache Directory Server. ese then pair with administrative tools such as Apache Directory Studio, Jxeplorer Java LDAP browser, or LDAP Admin Tool to manage accounts on those directories. One set of tools creates the initial process and the other manages tools for those implementations.

<span id="page-183-6"></span>SAML implementations work with identity providers to verify users. ey then provided an XML authentication exchange to conrm the user. e benet of this over LDAP is that SAML typically occurs outside the domain while LDAP functions are within the domain. It may be possible to use

both in establishing LDAPs within a particular cluster or cloud, while using SAML tokens for external access. e SAML authentication can then be connected to the directory for verifying which services are available at particular locations.

e top question for the platform may be which SSO I should use? e answer is that one depends on a particular capability rather than any specic soware in a platform. Multiple tools are available; one should look for the tool with the most integration across the capabilities you need. ese functions in the collaborative and deployment environments use the SSO. In any case, identity within the SSO should be encrypted at rest or in transit to prevent outside users from observing passwords.

#### Encryption basics

<span id="page-184-9"></span><span id="page-184-8"></span><span id="page-184-6"></span><span id="page-184-3"></span>All the discussion about encryption leads to a quick return to basic standards. Encryption has three basic forms: symmetric, asymmetric, and quantum keys. Symmetric encryption uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt the data. is model is known as "Secret Key" encryption because one must prevent third parties from seeing the key. e strengths include speed and cryptographic strength but the weakness is one must exchange keys before communicating securely. Two types of symmetric encryption exist; block, where set bit chains are encrypted through a secret key, and stream, where data encrypts during streaming without being retained in system memory. One of the challenges is that every key usage leaks some data about the encryption. Just like old-school cryptography, the more coded messages one has, the easier to nd the overall key. Symmetric keys do not include metadata about creation dates, user practices, or life spans, making it necessary to use key management systems. Examples of symmetric systems include Triple Data Encryption (3DES), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES), and Rivest Cipher 4()RC4.

<span id="page-184-10"></span><span id="page-184-7"></span><span id="page-184-2"></span><span id="page-184-0"></span>Asymmetric keys depend on public and private keys and appear in Figure 7.2, which details SSO practices. is practice is also known as public key encryption. e asymmetric encryption process is slower, and the keys are much larger in overall bits. At a high level, the system uses a pairing between public and private keys to decode messages. Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) systems use partial asymmetric approaches, with users obtaining a public key from a website and then linking to their private key to maintain security. Symmetric keys primarily use 128 or 256-bit functions, while asymmetric keys must be 2048 bits or more. Examples of asymmetric keys include Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), El Gamal, Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and Rivest-Shamir-Aldeman (RSA).

<span id="page-184-5"></span><span id="page-184-4"></span><span id="page-184-1"></span>Quantum encryption is an advanced topic and remains more theoretical than practical for day-to-day operations. ese methods currently occurs in either Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) or coin ipping. In QKD, participants exchange polarized photons. e unique quantum properties mean any observation of the photon changes the properties of the other. us, any eavesdropping would affect

the key received at either end and break the sequence. Coin ipping uses an agreement between users on polarized lters rather than the actual state, ensuring that only one valid key exists for the two users.

Another important consideration with quantum computing is its potential impact on key decoding. Grover's algorithm, a quantum search technique, signicantly reduces the number of items that need to be examined—from a typical (N/2 – 1) items, where N is the number of items in a set, in classical search to just the square root of N items in the quantum context—making key searches far more efficient. is means if one is randomly trying 1,000 possible options for a key, classical computing must try 499 alternatives, while a quantum approach requires only 37. is drastically reduces the time to commit brute-force decryption against public or private keys. One way to ensure all data is successfully encrypted is by putting suitable scanners and testing tools inside the pipeline. Even the best security on the local platform requires network management to ensure those moving onto one's platforms are secure.

#### Scanners and pipelines

<span id="page-185-1"></span>Security scans within the pipeline are part of the overall DevSecOps concept. Implementing these tools prevents harmful code from reaching production. A typical scanning package within a pipeline includes static testing to conrm coding practices, functional tests to verify elements, dependency scans to verify all called classes and objects exist, and run-time tests to verify that code runs as intended.

<span id="page-185-2"></span>When moving past the initial pipeline, developers frequently use smoke testing. Smoke testing originated with mechanical engineering, as when activating new devices, they did not catch on re, smoke, shake, or malfunction. Scans can also include regularly assessing deployed code to ensure new CVEs do not create vulnerabilities. e entire inventory of platform operations requires evaluation on a regular timeframe. New code testing occurs during development, but scanning on a weekly, quarterly, or other periodic timeframe prevents errors from reaching baseline capabilities.

<span id="page-185-0"></span>Pipelines should incorporate security scans into multiple stages with different jobs congured across the build, test, deploy, and operate phases. At the build stages, scanners conduct static analysis to verify code and functional code blocks. During testing, dynamic scans can evaluate what elements code calls, what ports are in place and verify embedded secrets are either removed or encrypted. During deployment, security tools verify against existing dependency CVEs, and ensure only the appropriate and approved networks are connected. Each security item produces artifacts for comparison with diff tools to ensure all security risks are understood. To be clear, diff tools do not solve problems, only highlight changes in security posture from one pipeline run to the next.

One best practice is incorporating diff tools directly into the pipeline. is practice allows creating artifacts directly showing security changes rather than handling the process later. Another best practice is incorporating pipeline tools that generate SBOM documentation upon deployment. e SBOM shows all the soware and versions incorporated within the deployed guide, and aids in completing later audits for the platform to obtain security certication.

<span id="page-186-15"></span><span id="page-186-13"></span><span id="page-186-11"></span><span id="page-186-9"></span><span id="page-186-4"></span><span id="page-186-2"></span>Multiple operational tools are available as open-source or by a vendor to scan operational inventories. OpenScap, Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), Snyk, and Anchore's Sy or Gype are effective scanning tools. Tenable's Nessus and Qualsys focus on networks, while anti-virus companies like McAfee, Norton, and BitDefender offer more detailed looks at singular nodes or small networks. Again, combining multiple tools into the platform structure will create the best value.

## <span id="page-186-16"></span><span id="page-186-10"></span><span id="page-186-8"></span><span id="page-186-7"></span><span id="page-186-3"></span><span id="page-186-0"></span>Network management and security practices use

<span id="page-186-14"></span>Securing the platform moves beyond the user experience portion to the networks and tools where platforms reside. Data and information move through channels, requiring secure practices to ensure adequate security. In this case, we are not talking about those on the platform but the path through which they reach the platform as the network tools. ese include a variety of protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Protocol (IP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) the most common as well as some others. Communication models can be point-to-point, clientserver, or publish-subscribe but each involves handshakes within the network.

<span id="page-186-6"></span><span id="page-186-5"></span>As an important background, Google initially drove the change from HTTP to HTTPS, a protocol using SSL, and then moved to TLS. e company began using HTTPS in 2008, implementing fulltesting in 2014 and 2018, marking sites not using the HTTPS protocol as "Not Secure". HTTPS uses the SSL interaction, which exchanges certicates, based on a public key, between the browsers. Once the connection is veried, the web server uses the public key access to send a secret key and establish a secure connection. TLS is a newer and updated version of SSL, removing existing vulnerabilities. As mentioned above, in patching, even security protocols are constantly rewired and recongured by stakeholders to eliminate vulnerabilities.

<span id="page-186-12"></span><span id="page-186-1"></span>Another important thing to remember across network management is the SYN-ACK handshake, expressing synchronization (SYN) and acknowledgment (ACK). In a typical handshake, the user sends a synchronization message to the server using the TCP or HTTPS function with an initial sequence number. Synchronization contains an initial sequence number, and the server responds with its own sequence number. e system increments these numbers to create the ACK message. Exchanging functions veries for both systems the establishment of a secure path. e challenge can be ensuring the establishment of the correct path when communicating. Network tools that help

ensure that platform users take the right path are functions including rewalls, traffic monitoring, and zero-trust policies.

## <span id="page-187-5"></span><span id="page-187-0"></span>Firewalls

<span id="page-187-3"></span><span id="page-187-1"></span>Firewalls are tools that prevent non-approved traffic from entering the service. ey are security systems designed to prevent authorized access to or from an existing network. In considering a platform, typically, positions from rewalls would be aer the initial user access and between any cluster sets. Firewalls ll a traditional security role in guarding against intrusion and signaling if a non-approved access is detected or approved. One can deploy rewalls as hardware, soware, or cloud-based systems. ese three can be congured at different points to secure different platform aspects.

e most common use for rewalls is preventing outside users from interfacing with private networks. In our platform design, the rewall would prevent unauthorized users from reaching the initial access point, and additional rewalls would prevent users from moving between clusters. As with other tools, the best rewall for the platform is the one that works best for your system.

ere are some elements to choose from in picking the best rewall approach. e rst is whether the system deploys as hardware, soware, cloud, or some combination of those locations. For our platform installation, some factors to consider are compatibility, scalability, performance, and manageability:

- Compatibility addresses how well the rewall works with the platform systems. Compatibility can be found in operating systems, applications, hardware and security features. Firewalls need to seamlessly integrate and control traffic regardless of which system, or combinations of systems might appear.
- Scalability is also a top concern for platforms, as user numbers may vary quickly. Scalability within the rewall addresses the ability to rapidly scale between numbers of users. Firewalls must manage high user numbers but also be able to switch to other rewalls if the system becomes overwhelmed. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks frequently seek to send more traffic than a rewall or server can handle, causing the system to shut down. Network Protocols play a key role in scalability, allowing systems to autodetect limits, manage between rewall elements, and keep systems from failing.
- <span id="page-187-4"></span><span id="page-187-2"></span>Performance is always important. One needs to assess how well a rewall works on the platform, how fast it passes traffic, and whether high availability exists. Each of these will vary from system to system and require testing for the expected platform load. is traffic point is an excellent spot to use Chaos Engineering to test for extreme loads. High availability with rewalls usually assesses if a secondary rewall will be activated when the initial load becomes too high. If a rewall load becomes excessive, the inability to move to secondary locations can impact user satisfaction through throttling traffic
- Manageability, the nal category, reects how easy a rewall is to use. In a cloud environment, using PaaS manageability might be a low concern as the same teams always manage that rewall. If one chooses to deploy a platform to multiple enterprise locations, this might increase in importance as one needs to train others in operation. e last part of manageability reects how your selected rewalls contribute to traffic monitoring practices in the following paragraphs.

Multiple ways exist to manage these factors. As with other areas, conducting a subjective and objective scoring against rewall categories can provide a strong comparative measure.

## <span id="page-188-8"></span><span id="page-188-0"></span>Traffic management

<span id="page-188-7"></span><span id="page-188-3"></span>Establishing good rewalls contributes to a solid traffic management process. Platforms are designed for multiple users, arriving from different locations and accomplishing different goals, so solid traffic management is essential. e key factors associated with traffic management are visibility, identifying user and organization habits, and establishing baselines. Once one sets these fundamental factors appropriately, the next step is nding appropriate remediation strategies.

- <span id="page-188-6"></span><span id="page-188-5"></span>Visibility within traffic management should address OSI layers two through seven. e platform concentrates on layers three through six, but since rewalls control traffic, the visibility needs to extend past those to the initial layers connecting with functions. Expanding observable layers account for north-south traffic within the cloud and east-west traffic from cluster to cluster or cloud to cloud. Despite having rewalls, these benet from using Test Access Points (TAP) and Switch Port Analyzers (SPAN) to help monitor traffic.
  - TAP: Passive device that copies network traffic and sends it to a monitoring tool. PhanTap is one example available as opensource from GitHub
  - SPAN: Forward copies of all incoming and outgoing packets from the existing switch to another port for analysis. Examples include the open-source tool WireShark which is a common favorite among those rst learning network integration

Both devices act without disrupting the ow of traffic, merely creating visibility for secondary and tertiary tools. TAP placement occurs between any two connected infrastructure pieces, whether physical or virtual, and SPANs oen appear in baseline network equipment.

e TAP captures inbound and outbound traffic, including all layer two and three packets. is device enables a full copy of multi-directional network traffic. SPAN ports tend to be more accessible and available at low user cost. e disadvantage of SPANs is that this traffic may not be prioritized and drops during high-traffic periods. e drop can then lead to holes in the visibility since the system does not achieve the full line rate. Combining the two systems provides a practical step into developing user behavior patterns.

- <span id="page-188-1"></span>Establishing monitoring allows for identifying user and organization habits. ese patterns allow one to rapidly differentiate between what might be an attack on the platform and what is standard behavior. One difficulty with behavior is that substantial data must exist before starting. in the next section, we discuss using AI/ML tools to facilitate analysis; however, the rst step is using architectural diagrams to envision what items communicate with others and what the standard patterns look like. Advanced monitoring tools such as DataDog, Honeycomb, and Salt are options as their initial installation provides some basic behavior patterns for Day 1. Many of these may rst seem like infrastructure management but offer the advanced analytics necessary for monitoring. ese can then be modied as one's platform becomes more mature
- <span id="page-188-4"></span><span id="page-188-2"></span>e priority for traffic management is to assess how different users implement the platform. Good monitoring practices show which tools are used most oen, how those tools are used and identify bottlenecks within the platform. Accentuating standard

monitoring tools with internal metrics occurs through virtual tools such as a personal favorite, Open Telemetry (OTEL).

- <span id="page-189-5"></span><span id="page-189-4"></span><span id="page-189-2"></span>OTEL: An open-source observability framework includes various tools, APIs, and Soware Development Kits (SDK). Enables teams to instrument, create, collect, and then export telemetry data to other tools to understand system performance and behavior. OTEL was a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project that merged two earlier projects, OpenTracing and OpenCensus. As open-source, the tool is free to download, has extensive documentation online, and a wide user community. Documentation and community are two essential parts we always consider when adding open-source tools to our platform. OTEL aims to provide details about multiple steps that traditional traffic management may miss.
- e last traffic management step should be establishing baselines. Previously mentioned was using existing vendors to contribute and creating multiple collection points. Baselines originate from three primary sources: dev, test, and ops. First, those creating the platform have ideas about how traffic should ow based on the initial architecture. ese baselines allow the creation of initial patterns to suggest traffic monitoring points. In the test phases, use cases allow experimenting with some patterns users might follow that the devs neglected. Testing use cases can include bad login attempts, moving incompatible formats between tools, or downloading data to personal devices.

<span id="page-189-6"></span><span id="page-189-3"></span>Testing then moves to operations, the platform deploys with actual users who choose to ignore everything the devs thought or tested. Chaos engineering practices in the operations can help cover even unthought attempts. An old planning instructor once told us that tests are not complete until the system has been secured against an invasion by Elvis clones from Mars.

is naturally leads to how AI can enhance one's security deployments.

#### <span id="page-189-7"></span><span id="page-189-0"></span>Leveraging AI for security enhancement

<span id="page-189-1"></span>e most important part of AI for the security environment is gaining another set of eyes to help with risk management and mitigation. Attention economics is a concept that frequently applies in any business but, especially in soware security. e concept details that the more areas one's attention has to deal with, the less attention is paid to any one item. In DevOps, attention economics expresses as context switching that occurs when one changes from one task to another, requiring a focused realignment. AI can be that security checker who never is distracted, cannot become bored with the repetitive work, and takes no coffee or lunch breaks. e below gure highlights all the potential places AI potentially integrates across the DevSecOps continuum.

ink of all the daily security inputs, suggestions, and alerts. No human can spend enough time to identify, become familiar with root causes, and resolve all those issues. However, in working so much faster than the human brain, an AI system can help provide a step through funneling items into actions requiring human intervention, and those actions are solvable through AI automation. Choosing an AI integration requires careful evaluation of categories including security focus, usability, and scalability. Aer carefully training the AI/ML models, one can supply security as defensive or offensive approaches and apply these functions.

#### <span id="page-190-6"></span><span id="page-190-0"></span>AI in defense

<span id="page-190-5"></span><span id="page-190-4"></span><span id="page-190-3"></span><span id="page-190-1"></span>AI in defense means establishing tools that protect the existing virtual infrastructure and network connections. Defensive models are the most common use for AI tools today. Defensive-focused AI vendors include Cylance, SentinelOne, and Vectra AI. e process involves using a trained AI model to examine all the current behavior and alert to unusual processes. AI practices in defense focus on endpoint security and proactive defense. Designing endpoint solutions applies AI to monitoring user behavior, detecting malware, and implementing preventative defensive methods.

A clear distinction exists in defense between detecting bad behavior through analysis and automatically implementing solutions. e initial detection is simple for most AI devices with standard ML training paths as structured or unstructured training models. is implementation allows the AI to alert when items exceed or are about to exceed, what appears as a standard usage. e next step allows an AI to implement a solution to x detected problems.

<span id="page-191-4"></span>e implementation phase can cause some consternation for many organizations. e ability of the AI to automatically stop harmful activity is practical but people worry whether essential solutions might impact business performance. For example, if an AI detects a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, and shuts down a port, will that same port impact the ability of customers to reach products? Solving this should allow the AI to take action but set up alert systems to notify human administrators. is notication ensures any actions taken are immediately subject to review. ese internal actions should pair with AI offensive solutions.

## <span id="page-191-5"></span><span id="page-191-0"></span>AI in offense

<span id="page-191-2"></span>When AI models are used to generate offensive security, the intent is to protect against future threats and investigate causes. Some companies specialize in these approaches; however, some legalities remain in question. e main concerns are how far an AI can go to investigate a potential threat and how one uses the information detected. Potential uses would include insurance lings, legal stoporders, or criminal actions against malicious actors.

<span id="page-191-3"></span>e best company for offensive AI security is probably DarkTrace, which specializes in real-time threat detection. Offensive AI solutions are likely to be more proprietary and require special knowledge. is means implementing offensive AI within the platform should not be preferred approach at the current time. Instead, organizations should contract with companies conducting offensive AI practices to provide information. is converts the AI from an offensive model to a defensive suggestion. ese defensive notes would feed into the training databases for the platform and limit legal liability. AI is an exciting tool; much work will likely further these options over the next several years.

#### <span id="page-191-6"></span><span id="page-191-1"></span>Summary

Our goal remains to help you better understand how to approach security in the DevOps cycle. Securing the platform by design requires understanding the design basics. Design basics include discovering security experience essentials by shaping platform ideation through parts, identity, presence, and opposites to form a better mental picture. e better you can dene the issue, the more possibilities exist to dene the ongoing interaction and envision long-term solutions.

We also went beyond the initial security design into the network interactions required to create an effective and secure platform. You must understand how the platform acts in isolation and those

elements interact with the broader world. e related solutions include best practices for SSO, rewalls, and traffic management. Finally, we discussed potential areas to include future AI tools within the platform security construct.

In the next chapter, we build from these initial design constraints to explore some actual applications and use-case involved with platforms in the market.

#### CALL TO ACTION

- Recognize the security concept behind your platform design.
- Identify how your platform will conduct actions to guard and signal against malicious or insider events.
- Model technology to support the initial ideation, and test those models.

In this chapter, we will present case studies showcasing successful platform transformations and the integration of platforms with business strategies. is chapter also shares some anti-patterns and stories of failed platform transformations that underscore the value of strategic planning and how enterprises with considerable heritage applications and legacy technologies can face disruptions. One of the ways we can succeed in the feedback and improvement aspects of DevOps is by capturing lessons from previous implementations and incorporating them to support current operations. is chapter also examines potential future technologies and solutions that have not yet been fully implemented. Reading this chapter will enable you to understand successful transformations, identify areas that can delay a transformation, and prepare for technological changes that will impact platforms.

In this chapter, you will explore the key elements that contribute to both successful and unsuccessful platform transformations. You'll begin by understanding the components of a successful transformation, including how to establish meaningful metrics and track performance effectively. en, you'll examine the factors that lead to unsuccessful transformations, learn to identify leading and trailing indicators of failure, and gain insights into how to better prepare for change. Finally, you'll delve into the role of evolving technology—understanding how it can impact a platform, when it's appropriate to implement changes, and how leveraging the right technologies can drive long-term success.

We will be covering the following main headings:

- Learning from successful platform transitions
- Evaluating unsuccessful transformations
- Best practices for platform success
- Innovating for new success
- Making technology leaps

#### <span id="page-193-5"></span><span id="page-193-2"></span>Learning from successful platform transitions

<span id="page-193-3"></span>You must be able to identify a strategy based on clear inputs to ensure a successful platform transformation. Returning to the basics of what makes platforms succeed will prepare you to implement successful processes and technologies. e model we will evaluate here is the original pyramid that establishes capabilities for stability, security, adaptability, and scalability across functions for supporting, designing, developing, deploying, and operating (Figure 8.1). e detailed discussion of this model occurred in [Chapter](#page-55-0) 2. Each layer and pillar plays a critical role in developing successful platforms.

![](_page_194_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-194-2"></span>Figure 8.1: DevSecOps pyramid

When getting started with a new platform, there is an emphasis on the initial development, deployment, and operations while still ensuring you are adhering to the pillars of stability, security, adaptability, and scalability. It can be difficult to evaluate each area and assign detailed metrics as the requirements change from organization to organization. However, assigning an initial metric can help with determining practical barriers to improving a platform or moving to a different provider.

One standard metric used across multiple organizations is indicators to establish levels of performance. ese include assessments such as availability on the network, response time to outages, query times for users, and resource utilization:

- <span id="page-194-0"></span>Service-Level Agreements (SLAs): ese are strategic-level discussions between the customer and the provider.
- Service-Level Objectives (SLOs): ese are the mid-level operational tasks to notify the organization when something exceeds bounds. Many organizations oen skip these mid-level connected points, especially smaller companies.
- <span id="page-194-1"></span>Service-Level Indicators (SLIs): ese are the rst worker-level notications about tasks within the system.

An example SLA might be 99% uptime, an SLO is to track routine uptime over a set increment, such as a week, while the SLI would be the current status indicator. Each would likely appear on dashboards.

<span id="page-195-3"></span>Designing these elements requires understanding what the platform needs for success. While considering each element provides an excellent path to success, we tend to skip SLOs. Coming up with mid-level objectives can be difficult for small companies, and even in large companies, they become simply an aggregate of SLI information. ese aggregates directly relate to the SLA, rather than establishing distinct elds. Instead of adding to the ability to identify and remediate issues, SLOs become a painful thought exercise for many individuals.

e next section expands on some SLA formats to accelerate platform success.

## <span id="page-195-4"></span><span id="page-195-0"></span>Service-level agreements for Platform Engineering

<span id="page-195-1"></span>e goal of any SLA should be to set the overall objective for the service provided. In our designed and engineered platform, our top objectives are as follows:

- <span id="page-195-2"></span>Development ease: Measure the rate at which code is committed, new features are released, or code is replaced
- Successful testing: Evaluate test coverage, successful tests, or artifacts associated with release
- Push to production: Evaluate how many expected features are released to customers
- Real-time support elements: Evaluate the time to recover aer failure, time to upgrade, and response time for help-desk elements

In establishing an SLA, six typical categories help ensure delity:

- Dene: Establish what the customer needs. Examples include 99% availability, less than 48 hours of downtime per year, 4 hours to respond to a support call, 30 minutes to respond to an outage, multiple pipelines can run simultaneously, and all critical security vulnerabilities are remediated before production.
- Document: Create an interaction that regularly reports on SLA status. As these items are typically longer in duration, weekly, monthly, or quarterly reports are best as a summation of dashboard activity.
- Agree: Most critical to the SLA process is the agreement between the customer and producer that the agreed-upon SLAs measure the right metrics.
- Monitor: Any dened SLA requires monitoring. e monitoring itself occurs with the SLIs, but the SLA should dene how monitoring occurs for each function. For example, the response to an outage might be per outage, or aggregated across multiple pipelines over time. Automated monitoring can reduce manual overhead, increasing the stability of the platform.
- Measure: e SLA should be dened to an acceptable level. While an initial SLA of less than 48 hours of downtime per year might be acceptable, noting downtime rates adds usability. If one has 30+ hours of downtime in the rst quarter, the SLA might be inappropriately scaled.
- Report: e SLA should include a reporting mechanism. An SLA that alerts the customer of potential lapses might be ineffective if a mechanism exists to remediate those lapses. is category relates to the monitor and document steps. Most important here is assessing when a problem exists where the customer requires notication and when issues are handled internally. For example, if

<span id="page-196-4"></span><span id="page-196-3"></span>the average ongoing outage time is 25 minutes, it might be valuable to identify the exceptions that exceed 30 minutes, as well as conrming the average.

All of these aspects are benecial when it comes to establishing SLIs as well. Each SLI constitutes a measurement that contributes to the SLA. e most important aspect here is creating automated systems tracking for the different aspects. If you are tracking an outage, the SLI will show the time it started, the time it stopped, who handled the issue, and perhaps a tier level for how difficult the challenge was to x. e SLI would also show availability at the current time, potentially aggregating into the overall SLA. While SLAs and SLIs provide a sound foundation, much can be learned through examining some successful scenarios of platform transformation.

## <span id="page-196-7"></span><span id="page-196-0"></span>Successful scenarios

Several commercial platforms have successfully delivered a customer platform and enhanced value through rapid production. We will look at some examples in this section.

#### GitLab

<span id="page-196-5"></span><span id="page-196-1"></span>One of the best DevOps platforms on the market is GitLab. e company expanded from the initial open source model developed in 2011 to create a business model, GitLab Inc., in 2014. e company uses a subscription model to offer differentiated product levels, although all are connected by similar SLAs and support. Gartner recognized GitLab as a leader in 2023 for their contributions to the DevOps Platform category. e company is entirely remote, with 1,800 team members across 60 countries and regions that support more than 1 million active users and 30+ million registered users.

What led to GitLab's successful transformation was an emphasis on stability, security, adaptability, and scalability. GitLab's transformation from the GitHub formats means many users are already familiar with the embedded tools. Including repository use as part of the basic pipeline framework emphasizes a continuation of previous skills. e basics for creating soware with GitLab are the same as many students learn in computer science classes throughout high school and college.

<span id="page-196-6"></span><span id="page-196-2"></span>ese features are then integrated with platform governance when using either a free or purchased platform version. Secrets can be embedded and shared within a project but not outside the project. Individual access accounts shape access, with organizations able to purchase a cloud-based system or local servers. At the same time, this allows for shared pipelines, running multiple pipelines, and analytics. Governance then links security automation to assist supply chain awareness and routine upgrades. Multiple security scans and tools are supported.

In considering adaptability and scalability, GitLab offers faster CI pipeline builds by using previously constructed toolsets. ese expansions augment speed and can build effective soware that benets

the organizational value stream. e GitLab website contains numerous use cases of companies who have purchased their soware and reached new heights:

- <span id="page-197-1"></span>Lockheed Martin (defense aerospace): Pipeline build speed increased over 80 times, thousands of Jenkins servers retired, and 90% less system maintenance time
- CACI International (defense IT services): Security scanning speeds increased 13 times, labor and admin costs reduced by over 90%, and consolidated over 7 tools into a common platform
- NVIDIA (advanced hardware): Enabled growth of over 51% during the rst year and 99% uptime delivered for the overall platform
- Carfax (vehicle retail): Reduced the toolchain from 12 tools to a single instance focused on feature delivery, created a 20% deployment boost over multiple years, and 30% of vulnerabilities identied earlier in the SDLC with secret detection as well as container and dependency scanning

Each of these companies experienced different successes. e common element between customers is that none had used a comprehensive platform before and integrating with GitLab created new success paths. Platforms are an enablement tool, allowing you to spend more time building and deploying soware rather than focusing on platform construction.

One complaint about the GitLab platform is that while the code merges and pipelines work effectively, including the generative AI GitHub Copilot and the GitLab Duo application, the overall work management aspects are still lacking. e platform has incorporated GitLab Issues to mimic other work management systems but lacks some operational aspects. e platform expertly performs at the build and deploy levels, but operationalizing those functions to the larger organization still requires some work. One big gap is visualizing ongoing work through tools such as Scrum and Kanban boards or creating supplementary documentation for issues. Despite these issues, GitLab is an excellent example of a tool that sparked a platform design and then made that platform available to others as a completed woodshop, allowing a focus on needed items.

#### Netflix

<span id="page-197-4"></span><span id="page-197-3"></span><span id="page-197-2"></span><span id="page-197-0"></span>On the other side of the model, a well-known company that successfully integrated platforms into daily practices is Netix. Netix was one of the rst adapters in the broader marketplace for successful container and automated system use. Many of the initial chaos engineering practices, such as the Chaos Monkey deployment, originated with Netix. Chaos Monkey and associated tools, known as the Simian Army, test the operational Netix environments for errors that have not yet occurred but are eventual possibilities.

In 2020, Netix took on a signicant tooling reversion to bring its development workforce into a stable platform. Brian Leathern led these transformations. He found that the microservices architecture originally used was becoming increasingly fragmented as the company expanded. e platform goals were to manage multiple services, enable discovery, and allow context switching. An example of a workow that created a problem was using Bitbucket to review pull requests, Spinnaker to check deployment pipelines, and Jenkins to analyze build failures, and then having multiple internal tools for metrics regarding operational status. Every deployment required manual pushes between tools, rather than using a consistent platform.

ese multiple interactions became increasingly complicated as the architecture continued to grow. Not only were the operational tools difficult to use, but the wide variety meant developers were oen unaware of new tools and processes added to the overall chain. One team's shortcuts on Bitbucket or Spinnaker, for example, might only appear in their local documentation. Further, solutions to common xes were not distributed across the platform but only appeared in local implementations.

<span id="page-198-3"></span><span id="page-198-1"></span>Netix started by building a platform architecture and moving into a federated platform Minimum Viable Product (MVP). A key aspect was not just moving existing experiences into a new platform, as might happen with a common Single Sign-On (SSO), but ensuring full integration so that the tools communicate with each other. is communication enabled viewing the entire SDLC, not just a small portion, from a development perspective. One innovative concept was the ability to use collections, selecting multiple elements within the platform to build a customized workow. ese workows were then still visible from every level.

<span id="page-198-2"></span>One key takeaway from Netix's experience, which remains ongoing, is that platforms must do more than consolidate business functionality. An effective platform must integrate workows and create knowledge about new functions. During the transition, platform engineers must be able to show how the new platform reduces time and effort. e GitLab example showed multiple instances of reducing time and providing useful tools. A quick look through the Netix TechBlog ([www.netixtechblog.com](http://www.netflixtechblog.com/)) reveals the many challenges faced during their platform implementation, however. Overall, Netix continues to be successful, with gross prot margins routinely exceeding 35% across multiple quarters.

Successful transformations indicate clear wins for companies that have integrated Platform Engineering. Companies and organizations are always more willing to discuss successes than failures. Diving into unsuccessful transformations becomes more of an exercise in personal experiences with different instantiations rather than published use cases. e next section evaluates some aspects that lead to unsuccessful or incomplete transformations.

## <span id="page-198-5"></span><span id="page-198-0"></span>Evaluating unsuccessful transformations

<span id="page-198-4"></span>Establishing SLAs and practical standards can lead to a successful transformation as you'll be focusing on stability, security, adaptability, and scalability. But those same focuses can also derail the transformation. An overemphasis on one area can leave a platform with some areas where it is highperforming but allow the rest to remain seriously out of balance. Sometimes, an unsuccessful transformation can be a matter of opinion rather than a practical application. Small things such as User Experience (UX), tool integration, and update processes can matter when promoting a platform for internal or external use. Examples of these challenges are provided here:

- <span id="page-199-3"></span>Small challenges: Examples of these are user happiness, tool integration, and update processes. ese affect time to production, UX, and support ticket metrics.
- Large challenges: Examples of these are lack of architecture and vision alignment, continually stuck in the in-progress stage, rather than done, with no working platform, separation from the user base, and no simple green-eld to brown-eld changes. In these cases, useful metrics are unavailable as users have not adopted platforms.

Recognizing potential challenges is a critical rst step, but truly understanding those challenges is a required skill for a platform engineer. Each of these topics is discussed in detail in further sections.

## <span id="page-199-4"></span><span id="page-199-0"></span>Small challenges

<span id="page-199-2"></span><span id="page-199-1"></span>ese small challenges appear in the complete use case that follows on Atlassian. e reasons for this failure start with a poor UX based on developer unhappiness, high numbers of support tickets, and an increase in time to production. Fixing these issues requires making process and technical changes to the existing platform. Teams oen x these issues locally, but the challenge comes with communicating and integrating those xes into the larger platform.

Users can be nicky, and small changes in an existing platform can create high levels of consternation. Any movement of standard elements between different areas requires assessment through models such as alpha-beta implementations. Examples include changing repository structures, providing new tool options, or proliferating local shortcuts. ese require allowing a few users to test a beta implementation and provide comments before broader dissemination. is alpha-beta model prevents large changes from stalling user production as a result of changing common paths without a solid path for new training and documentation. ese example methods can help resolve user dissatisfaction while another effective indicator is support tickets submitted and resolved.

Support tickets should always be a signicant indicator of platform experience. Lacking a comprehensive support team is a crucial indicator of an unsuccessful transformation. DevOps states that the team that builds soware runs it, but expanding from small teams to large user bases can compromise these improvements. Effective support models have three levels to help maintain DevOps improvements:

- Tier 1: Questions about platform usage with information present in documentation
- Tier 2: Changes in conguration requiring administrator assistance
- Tier 3: Bugs or new features

To clarify, a bug occurs when something should work based on the original delivery but does not, and a feature refers to when a user wants something that is not included in the initial scope. With new platforms, the initial Tier 1 ticket numbers will be high, and then those numbers likely convert into more Tier 2 tickets as users become more familiar with operations. Tier 3 ticket numbers should always be low as bugs usually appear in development and testing, while new feature suggestions help design the next steps.

e last common small challenge occurs with tool integration and update processes. When discussing GitLab, we saw the ease with which les and code can easily be associated with projects, be transferred into pipelines, and reach production. In poor platforms, you might see code contained in different areas than documentation and work progress managed on different tools, lacking connection. For example, coding work might be carried out in one tool and code changes reported in a different management tool, rather than the two being connected. is gap means that when a developer submits and merges new code, they must enter a new system log changes. Changing systems can slow down production and impact observability for the entire team.

<span id="page-200-1"></span>Following tool integration is the platform update process. Continually updating soware with DevOps standards requires constant updates. Update management should either be transparent to the user or occur at set times. Transparency involves notifying users when updates occur and providing highlevel information and links to more details. ese updates can be functional changes linked to new tutorials or security updates, or even communicating backend changes to improve performance. Regular updates create rapport with users, informing users about when ticketed problems and basic xes will be addressed. When new security patches are released, users may deluge support functions with requests for updates. Staying ahead of this creates an effective platform. Despite xing small changes, many platforms struggle with more signicant and extensive issues.

## <span id="page-200-4"></span><span id="page-200-3"></span><span id="page-200-0"></span>Large challenges

<span id="page-200-2"></span>As mentioned earlier, large challenges can include poor integration between vision and architecture, inability to reach a production platform, lack of user response, and no brown-eld to green-eld model. Each of these poses a severe problem, with any one derailing production but a combination turning a good platform vision into a continuous resource drain. Addressing these requires coordination across an organization, confronting top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top issues. A common error that occurs is no communication or feedback in DevOps existing in veried and effective channels. is analysis goes back to Conway's law, where systems produced by an organization tend to mirror the organization's structure, with hierarchical organizations creating hierarchical tools and at organizations creating at models.

An inability to complete the transformation effectively is common. is happens most oen when teams try to build their platform. e transformation vision starts with the effective planning converted to architecture demonstrated in early chapters. Teams oen develop a vision of what they expect but lack an architectural plan. One example is teams that have comprehensive week-to-week delivery schedules and excellent ve-year plans but lack the middle section where deliveries connect to the overall strategy. Some engineers jump from large problems to immediate solutions without architectural integration. e result is excellent code in many different areas but either no comprehensive integration or numerous manual shortcuts required for success.

Another key factor can be misleading indicators during a standard metrics analysis. A platform may successfully enable one application to reach production but fail for others. While one application may deploy successfully, the Platform Engineering has failed. Successful platforms enable multiple applications to succeed by offering an integrated base with opinionated but not prescriptive solutions. Some companies can drive certain elements better on one platform than others, creating near-term success and long-term complications. We oen see this appear on code-specic platforms such as Python or Java, or a function-specic one such as one for testing or security. ese can be short-term xes but fall short of the desired platform end goal.

<span id="page-201-1"></span><span id="page-201-0"></span>One of the rst indications that a platform failed during a transformation is user response. Deploying the initial platform involves the engineering build, coordinating Infrastructure as Code ( IAC), and pushing products to production. When doing this, you must remember to measure the UX. Users tend to like using certain tools and functions. If you remove those functions, even if for a positive engineering outcome, users may decide not to use the platform. A common example is when platforms perform actions for the user without telling the user. is could result in the user duplicating code, for example, which could break the intended function. Platforms must focus on user happiness and be transparent in their functions. If we return to our woodshop example from Chapter 2, you could offer pre-cut wood lengths and [demonstrate](#page-55-0) design elements, but users will want to see all the platform options. In technical terms, this can be as simple as offering a pull-down menu, or an approval button.

Another key area where many platforms fail is not offering sufficient instructions on use. is failure appears most commonly in changing brown-eld to green-eld solutions. Developers previously built an application and then want to migrate to a new platform. In building their application, developers may make choices that are no longer available. Good platforms must offer easy ways to align these models. Common failures in this area relate to programming languages, database schema, or testing versions. For example, an application may be promoted to production based on an earlier security test. e application no longer passes the pipeline when the platform includes the latest security versions. Notifying users of how development and production affects them and the associated

platform solutions can mitigate these frustrations. Solution notication to users can be an area where GenAI solutions excel, automating the process rather than requiring manual solutions. e following two case studies are examples of where we have seen unsuccessful platform implementations.

#### Atlassian

<span id="page-202-0"></span>Atlassian is known for offering one of the best starting points for companies managing a DevOps transformation. Tools such as Jira and Conuence are widespread throughout the commercial market. Jira offers a customized Kanban or Scrum solution that expands into project management across multiple levels. Some new instantiations of Jira Cloud even offer high-level management of multiple teams. Conuence offers documentation and notes that are fully interactive with the Jira solution and supplement those functions. However, in our opinion, Atlassian has a failed platform.

e company offers integrated solutions with other functions such as Bitbucket to manage code and SonarQube to address security. While each function appears on the platform, they lack proper integration. Bitbucket is part of the Atlassian suite but SonarQube is a recommended plugin requiring additional integration. Users pull Jira tickets and releases into Conuence, and vice versa, but the mechanics tend to be convoluted. Jira tickets are not easily connected to Bitbucket outcomes or SonarQube reports. is discrepancy forces developers to move through multiple windows and cut and paste data to attain a single source of truth. ese single sources are more easily obtained by other platforms.

At the same time, linking the issues is not always communicated across the platform, creating a challenging work environment. Visualizing change in status may require launching a new application rather than being observed within the current window. Working with actual code from Bitbucket but having to log changes in other features becomes very difficult for the average user. e platform problems begin with the advanced knowledge required and continue through difficult and needlessly complex administrative tools. Users oen require multiple administrative passwords across each tool, rather than using a shared admin account for all responsibilities.

One of the most common problems with Jira occurs in the workow process. Bitbucket's pipeline elements do not automatically mirror to Jira and are even more difficult when GitLab is integrated into Atlassian tools. Additionally, many teams try to create their own workows despite all projects being in a common organization. An example would be one team using stages of to-do, in-progress, and done, while another uses code1, deploy, revise, code2, test1, deploy2, and nished. Trying to resolve progress across these multiple teams becomes challenging. Bitbucket links may be copied into a Jira ticket but it requires switching functions to determine progress.

Another simple failure of Atlassian, in dealing with user satisfaction, is that despite multiple user requests, as evidenced by their community board, they have never included wildcard searches across their platform. A wildcard search is when a special character, such as \*, is used before or in an alphanumeric string to nd an item. is feature gap means that searching Atlassian requires knowing the exact name of the desired object. Without a wildcard search, users must search multiple combinations or scroll through lesystems to nd the desired object. is small absence can cause high levels of frustration for users.

One nal problem with Atlassian is the numerous security challenges. e company has had numerous failures over the years with multiple critical and high vulnerabilities released in the past 12 months. A single critical vulnerability can derail a system, but multiple vulnerabilities affect system performance and user attitudes. Each vulnerability is bad, but the rst critical vulnerability of 2024 resulted in 39,000 access attempts across 18,000 ports from 600+ IP addresses in the rst week. Some issues were xed but many continue or have yet to appear. e sheer number of vulnerabilities suggests key gaps within the system with the potential for future exploitation.

<span id="page-203-0"></span>Combining the lack of integrated solutions, workow challenges, and user happiness highlights the key failures within the Atlassian tools. e systems may work well for a time but fail over the long term when adhering to key platform creation pillars. e platform's lack of integration challenges stability, a security problem is posed due to multiple vulnerabilities, user satisfaction declines, showing the lack of adaptability, and initially scalable, non-integrated workows pose challenges as the system expands. Despite business successes, if you are looking at what not to do from a Platform Engineering perspective, Atlassian is that model.

#### United States federal government

<span id="page-203-2"></span><span id="page-203-1"></span>From a personal perspective, in our experience working with United States (U.S.) federal programs and contractors, the government's soware factories frequently demonstrate poor practices. Many problems originate not from the government workers or their capacity to deliver but from outdated administrative requirements. e Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), a massive document with 2,000+ pages across 37 chapters, supplements for various agencies, and then cost accounting standards, poses much of this challenge. Despite being updated over the years, the regulations are more geared toward the slower material and labor acquisition model, rather than being the fast-paced standard needed for delivering an effective platform, and the subsequent soware.

Many government agencies experience personnel change at a high rate and cannot maintain progress. ese changes occur at worker and management levels. One program we worked for saw regular turnover between 30% and 50% at all levels. is turnover created challenges in meeting team goals. In another instance, the key stakeholder insisted the key to progress was making no changes to the

quarterly plan due to capacity maximization, but then personally added another 800 hours of required tasks within the rst week. In other cases, turnover issues extend to leadership, who bring in new plans and ideas, overhauling previous work.

One key challenge in the government processes, accentuated by FAR, is the focus on labor hours rather than completion. e regulatory inability to correctly identify developing soware versus completed deliveries places a premium on labor time rather than completed delivery. For example, an agency that wants a legacy database application migrated to a platform must hire developers for a set period rather than contracting them for a potential delivery. Visualizing this, it would mean hiring 8 developers for 40 hours a week over 12 months rather than allowing a company to suggest an application delivery at a set cost within six weeks. Considering that the standard developer rate is over \$100 per hour, the cost would be \$16M versus what might be a much smaller cost for the application.

Another challenge government platforms face is converting from brown-eld to green-eld systems. e U.S. government systems are so large and embedded that they cannot change small parts without breaking the entire system. A good platform's scalable and adaptive aspects exemplify constant improvement, but this can be impossible with some legacy systems. An excellent example is from the COVID era, when a state government needed to nd COBOL developers to update an old system. is conversion had previously been required but data transfer and limited contractual opportunities presented as challenges.

At the same time, government regulations oen require multiple human tests beyond the soware capability of DevOps. One organization we are familiar with was contracted to provide user-requested updates quarterly. Aer the rst two updates, the government organization reported that they could not perform testing and requested that the developers slow down with delivering updates, despite the stated and contractual requirement for update delivery. e requested slowdown would lead to producing one update every 6 to 9 months, leading to user dissatisfaction, threatening the ability to maintain security, and impacting soware performance. As with DORA metrics, platforms aim to support continuous delivery when updates complete, not when a user is available for a two-week testing cycle.

ese examples focused on U.S. government operations. When shiing to a different model, such as those used in China, we see that many of their platforms are state-sponsored. State-sponsored platforms are created using government funds and sold on the open market. At other times, China mandates the use of a specic platform, constraining user choice, as follows:

- Jihu replaces GitLab.
- Weibo replaces Twitter.
- WeChat replaces Facebook.

<span id="page-205-2"></span>Alibaba replaces Amazon.

<span id="page-205-5"></span>e Chinese Communist Party (CCP) reverse-engineers platforms, ignores intellectual property constraints, and then empowers a Chinese production company. ey also ban Western platforms, or any similar applications, allowing users only to implement Chinese solutions. Metrics are then skewed by state-mandated usage, with over one billion users adopting the platform. ese state mandates are only successful in regions with authoritarian governments, rather than open competition, as factors other than security, scalability, adaptability, and stability drive usage.

Many government platform aws are contractual. Others are a result of mindset. Previous chapters emphasized culture, leadership, and organizational standards and showed that Platform Engineering is not just a technical solution. Articially slowing down platform delivery primarily impacts security and stability. However, the inability to respond to user requests promptly also challenges a platform's adaptability and scalability. It is not enough to purchase a platform transformation; in line with Conway's law, the organization must prepare for change. e following section highlights some best practices that can drive successful transformation and ways to recognize future trends.

#### <span id="page-205-6"></span><span id="page-205-0"></span>Best practices for platform success

Recognizing some best practices that accelerate delivery, integration, and subsequent growth is key to ensuring successful transformation. is section identies best practices, sets some initial guidelines, and proposes ways to ensure platforms remain current. A quick list of these best practices is as follows:

- <span id="page-205-3"></span>Service platforms.
- Recognize growth limits.
- Don't build what already exists.
- Establish metrics.

e technology supporting platforms is constantly changing, and we must ensure a suitable mindset to anticipate these changes exists. ere are multiple ways of incorporating changes; these best practices function as a guide rather than an exhaustive list. Let's delve deeper into them.

#### <span id="page-205-7"></span><span id="page-205-1"></span>Service platforms

<span id="page-205-4"></span>We should never forget that, despite the technological origins, humans build, operate, and use platforms. If a human uses a machine, it will require some form of service. Many organizations overlook this or attempt to divert support responsibilities to the purchasing customer. Some form of service should be readily available within a platform. Service examples are embedded knowledge bases, a common messaging system, routine notications, and competent service staff.

Knowledge bases can take the form of notes pages and documentation. Readily available tools can convert code comments or Markdown language in repositories into clear documents. Along with this, systems can provide notications for updates, downtime, or suggested training. Common metrics such as availability and usage are oen hidden rather than shared with users. Sharing this knowledge builds condence across multiple levels.

<span id="page-206-2"></span>When these rst support attempts fail, users should be able to reach a human or AI-driven service to address their issues. e support staff's rst goal should be to identify problems as Tier 1, within the documentation; Tier 2, minor conguration changes; or Tier 3, a bug or feature. All issues should be tracked in an observable format for users and admins, such as ServiceNow or another ticketing system. is creates issue observability and allows rapidly aligning metrics. One key example of AI support is chatbots. ese provide a place for users to ask questions and receive a tailored response that guides them through specic answers.

## <span id="page-206-3"></span><span id="page-206-0"></span>Recognize growth limits

<span id="page-206-1"></span>Every new platform wants to be the most successful, with the widest adoption and the highest prot. ese goals conict with a platform's activity to deliver support. Successful platform implementations might follow the Netix model as a user platform versus a development orientation, or GitLab where the service burden falls on the users. True DevOps Platform Engineering incorporates multiple areas. One of the hardest things is realizing that while scalability is important, there are also times when growth needs to be constrained.

All platforms might eventually support millions of users, but the growth occurs over time. You must realize the performance limits within the existing platform. Netix grew from 24M subscribers in 2011 to over 220M in 2023; however, most growth areas maintained a steady pace of growth of 20% to 30% in any individual year. Any platform model should strive for a similar pace, expanding the capability to plan for and match customer growth. Customer growth is the best model to generate long-term value and prot. Research methods such as surveys gathering user feedback and market intelligence can help companies plan for what growth levels to expect. Unicorn-style growth is always hoped for but rarely achieved, and many companies would be incapable of handling growth of 100% or greater in a short period.

In our previous experience, a company was determined to succeed through offering a technical feature and spent thousands of hours and dollars achieving that capability. It was only aer they had nished the development that they realized that only about 10 users would be using the feature, and

the user count was unlikely to grow based on need. Growth should be carefully mapped and discussed. Small changes and features contribute to growth but require alignment to actual customer use. ese alignments can be checked through UX metrics using surveys and operational metrics tracking usage.

## <span id="page-207-3"></span><span id="page-207-0"></span>Don't build what already exists

<span id="page-207-2"></span>Many existing products are perfect for supporting platform development and deployment. Integrating tools can create early successes. Many of these tools either are open source or require minimal licensing fees. e rst step when considering tool options should always be whether the tool is available through open source or licensed models. e best practice here is to recognize when you can rent, buy, and build when considering platform options.

Open source offers an answer, but not the only answer. Companies such as GitLab, Databricks, Elastic, MongoDB, and JFrog, among others, offer some portion of their code as open source. If a generic solution is the answer, these can be adopted into the platform early and switched to a paying model as growth increases. e ability to switch from open source to paid licensing by a provider makes this an example of the rent model.

Vendor lock-in is a common problem with the rent model. is means that if you wish to change data, architectures, or applications, they cannot be easily converted to a new model. e interoperability of many DevOps systems reduces how oen true vendor lock-in occurs. A good application that leads to long-term success may be preferred by an organization over the ability to switch at some future date. is addresses the Agile and DevOps philosophies that teams must be able to change easily but those changes can also occur within a tightly coupled structure.

Buying soware can be either an outright purchase or through a subscription model. Subscription models offer limited-time solutions but open the possibility of vendor lock-in when options are too constrained. For example, Atlassian offers subscriptions to build platform capability, but if you later switch, it requires moving databases. Limited or excessive elds can create challenges here. Buying delivers value if you intend to retain the soware for an extended time. e best purchases are oen security, resource management, and program management. Processes such as CI/CD, testing, and other deployments change frequently, and the rent model is more effective in creating immediate value.

<span id="page-207-1"></span>e last option is building functions. ese build options are oen the last step when you believe an internal solution can achieve better than what is offered on the market. Platform Engineering can require a mix of an IAC and Conguration as Code (CAC) build that drives the integration of other rented or bought pieces. Rather than building each piece, modern platform architecture allows

<span id="page-208-3"></span>making those integrations proprietary without intensive preparation. One example might be purchasing a repository and SSO system with your organization creating an integration allowing SSO control of the repository. Integration builds tend to be lighter-weight constructions than full functionality.

## <span id="page-208-5"></span><span id="page-208-0"></span>Establish metrics

<span id="page-208-4"></span>Metrics are always required for DevOps. ese measurements should be tailored depending on what you want to achieve. Setting acceptance criteria within different builds should determine what metrics are later measured by the organization. e DORA metrics are excellent in initial development practices as they provide ow rates and capacity measurement, while later measuring repair and recognition times. You can supplement these metrics with additional statistics about usage, availability times, performance rates, security linkages, and others.

A common path for including metrics is the previously mentioned path to establish SLAs and SLIs for required items. ese expand beyond the initial measurement to create a contract between the user and provider. Moving metrics from a measurement to a value-creating option is always a best practice. We discussed SLAs in detail earlier in this chapter.

It is important to remember with metrics that establishment oen leads to gamication. In gamication, one is focused simply on achieving the metric rather than the underlying goal. You can rectify this by frequently evaluating metric success or establishing cross-referencing metrics. A good example is in code commits: if a metric requires more frequent commits, users may shrink the commit size; however, reaching the overall goal still takes the same time. You can compare the code commit frequency with time to customer and commit sizes. is allows for evaluating the best size to commit, and at what time, to reach customer value.

#### <span id="page-208-6"></span><span id="page-208-1"></span>Innovating for new success

<span id="page-208-2"></span>ough innovation can be considered a best practice, it deserves separate consideration. Innovation can oen be narrowly constrained to the next technology hurdle, but all aspects of the platform matter. Business innovation can be just as important as elding new technology since it can rapidly bring more customers. Too many companies tend to focus solely on building the latest technology, rather than improving internal practices. At the same time, a business model lagging behind technical solutions may be incapable of supporting either value or growth. Teams should encourage innovation through practices such as hackathons, regular downtime for special projects, employee training budgets, conference attendance, publication, and widespread experimental options.

<span id="page-209-6"></span><span id="page-209-4"></span>One platform pillar that remains constant is stability. In considering innovation, people oen struggle between differentiating evolutionary changes and revolutionary changes. An evolutionary change makes small steps from the current model, and a revolutionary change rewrites the underlying model. For example, BlackBerry moving from a number pad to a full keyboard on cell phones was an evolutionary change, but Apple's move from a cell phone to the full-scale smartphones of today was revolutionary. Finding a balance between adopting these changes is a key component of business. Historic examples of failures at multiple levels are IBM stating personal computers would never happen, Kodak rejecting digital lm, Sears rejecting the change from catalog to e-commerce, Yahoo not buying Google in 1998 for \$1M, and Atari viewing gaming as an individual rather than a shared process.

<span id="page-209-3"></span><span id="page-209-2"></span>An important innovation discussion is recognizing the difference between cutting-edge and bleedingedge technologies. Cutting-edge implies the newest solutions available on the market, while bleedingedge is typically technology that is not widely available. An example of cutting-edge technology is television moving from tube to digital to LCD to LED, and then multiple generations, improving pixel count, color, and transmission. A current bleeding-edge technology might be quantum networks, neural-linked devices, or multi-purpose AI assistants. Each technology realizes a problem but does not currently have the market or operations to support wider-scale adoption.

Platforms should attempt to include cutting-edge solutions while researching the bleeding edge but not expect customer adoption. Bleeding-edge solutions, despite increased capability, can oen be derailed by things such as common formats or usability. Some examples are conicts between laser disc, Beta, and VHS formats or audio with records, 8-tracks, cassettes, and CDs in the video recording industry. Both areas then faced a challenge with the growth of digital media and streaming transmissions.

Striking the right balance between innovation and usability sets the stage for understanding how to thoughtfully adopt and integrate new technologies.

## <span id="page-209-7"></span><span id="page-209-0"></span>Making technology leaps

<span id="page-209-5"></span>Understanding technological change is the rst step in implementing change through integration and adaptation. is leads to the question, what type of technology should I consider next? Everyone wants to nd the next big thing, but rarely does a revolutionary change occur. Evolutionary platform technology focuses on several components: compute improvements, storage growth, and UI interaction. Each of these offers benets but should be considered against the overall strategy.

## <span id="page-209-8"></span><span id="page-209-1"></span>Compute

<span id="page-210-7"></span><span id="page-210-3"></span>e rst improvement for a platform deals with improving capacity to compute. Additional compute generally costs more money and deals with adding additional cores either to on-premises servers or through virtual machines. Changing from a CPU core to a GPU core improves the ability to deliver specialized actions. One other factor might be adding quantum cores. While adding quantum sounds difficult, capabilities such as Amazon Braket enable using quantum machines without purchasing these solutions. Other upcoming changes include the following:

- <span id="page-210-6"></span>Graphene-based transistors: Graphene uses one-carbon-atom-thickness materials with increased connectivity, rolled into tubes, and uses less space and energy. ese tubes can be combined with other 2D materials to increase transmission speed. Graphene nano-tubes are expected to reach the market within the next ve years.
- <span id="page-210-10"></span>Neuromorphic: Technology involving neuromorphic systems calls for replicating human brain architecture. e difference in problem-solving would require signicantly less energy than traditional models. is technology lags as most attempts to mimic biological processes still involve internet protocols removing the advantage from the improved structures.
- <span id="page-210-11"></span>Optical transmission: Transmitting with optical methods uses photons rather than electrons, mapping data with light-intensity levels, and varying levels to perform calculations. Realized optical methods could improve efficiency and decrease power but challenges remain with integration and portability.

## <span id="page-210-17"></span><span id="page-210-0"></span>Storage

<span id="page-210-12"></span><span id="page-210-8"></span>Storage may not be as widely needed in basic Platform Engineering as dealing with data coming across the platform. At some point, applications, especially AI/ML applications, require more data to be successful. Making that data accessible to the platform creates challenges, especially as the data produced extends into the terabyte and petabyte ranges. Estimates suggest the world's production of data exceeds 400 million terabytes daily. Most platforms do not require these levels, but being prepared means you can offer customers advanced capabilities:

- <span id="page-210-15"></span><span id="page-210-5"></span>DNA data storage: Converts existing data from a binary base 2 into a DNA-based base 4. is allows increasing the overall capacity so much that some researchers believe the world's storage needs could be met with a cubic meter of powdered E. coli DNA. Challenges to this mode involve reading and writing with proteins.
- <span id="page-210-14"></span><span id="page-210-4"></span>Diamond data: is involves using lasers to store data in nanoscale diamonds with laser pulses. ese techniques are read-write capable, and a single, 5 cm diamond wafer can store up to a billion Blu-ray discs, or about 25 exabytes.
- <span id="page-210-13"></span><span id="page-210-2"></span>Blockchain: Blockchain storage has been around for a while but only for specic and limited functions. Extending successful blockchain into different and streaming data would improve the security and condentiality of systems. Blockchain storage improvements are more likely to emerge from soware solutions than user-driven suggestions.

#### <span id="page-210-18"></span><span id="page-210-1"></span>User interface

<span id="page-210-16"></span><span id="page-210-9"></span>e last major area to improve platforms through technology is the user interface. While the user interface may seem peripheral, improvements in how individuals interact with platforms can create an enormous market advantage. A good example is Netix, where the change from a mail-based system

to on-demand streaming improved users' ability to access and view data. Some of the top trends in the user interface are highlighted here:

- <span id="page-211-4"></span><span id="page-211-2"></span>Interactive 3D: is user approach appears in many science ction movies but its applications are wide-ranging is would enable a user to view, edit, and work in 3D spaces, rather than being conned to a traditional monitor and keyboard conguration. Its implementation would mean making movements to access and congure platform applications, such as a hand signal to call code, run pipelines, and apply testing results.
- <span id="page-211-8"></span><span id="page-211-6"></span><span id="page-211-3"></span><span id="page-211-1"></span>Virtual and augmented reality interfaces: ese solutions are similar to interactive 3D but conned to a specic element. For example, 3D glasses can give the appearance of interaction without requiring a full 3D display. Augmented reality allows suggesting additional interactions, possibly by optical or audio inputs, to suggest changes within viewed applications.
- <span id="page-211-7"></span><span id="page-211-5"></span>Virtual assistants: Many virtual assistants exist today in the form of chatbots, and other guides. You may even think of voiceactivated integrations such as Siri or Alexa as virtual assistants. e next improvement, especially for platforms, will likely be AI tracking daily activities to suggest improvements. For example, think about an AI system that understands a worker's ability and can make tailored suggestions, notifying of additional training when they exceed certain parameters for time or quality with applications.

Preparing for the future involves a blend of implementing best practices and preparing for new technology. Best practices are people and process improvements such as providing service, creating growth opportunities, and updating metrics. Technological changes require recognizing the next steps for compute, storage, and UI improvements, such as quantum computing, DNA storage devices, and virtual chatbots. ese techniques were demonstrated in the preceding best and worst case studies as the organizations attempted to achieve accelerated Platform Engineering.

## <span id="page-211-9"></span><span id="page-211-0"></span>Summary

Beginning with successful transformations, this chapter introduced SLA frameworks as a guideline for DevOps success. Incorporating an SLA establishes guidelines between the user and customer, enabling the determination of success or failure. While SLAs can be largely similar between different platforms, successful platforms such as GitLab and Netix incorporated multiple paths to reach overall success.

Conversely, unsuccessful platform transformations fail to address small and large platform construction challenges adequately. Small challenges tend to be technical or operational, such as the failure of a tool, poor service, or bad metrics. Large challenges are more strategic, with platforms unable to align vision with architecture and the inability to make deliveries on time. DevOps is all about continuous value, so anything impacting that delivery can cause failure. e transformation failures highlighted included Atlassian and government processes.

Finally, the chapter concluded by identifying some high-level best practices and upcoming technological improvements for platform innovation. Platforms need to grow through increased value and an expanding customer base. Realizing this requires building effectively, incorporating existing

technology, measuring success, and keeping up with innovation. Best practices provide guidelines to measure future success. Once challenges are identied, the following step requires ensuring that testing and measurement processes exist to maintain continuous success. e next chapter examines testing models in development, quality assurance in delivery, and successful operating platforms.

#### CALL TO ACTION

- Establish SLAs and SLIs driven by your strategic goals for the platform.
- Routinely evaluate others in the field to learn from their successes and failures.
- Search new technological advances for what revolutionary and evolutionary advances exist.

## <span id="page-213-7"></span><span id="page-213-1"></span><span id="page-213-0"></span>Testing, Quality Assurance, and Operations

<span id="page-213-5"></span>Platform solutions build beyond the basics to offer standardized pipelines and testing processes. Successfully implementing these processes generates repeatable Bodies of Evidence (BoEs) that allow measuring all soware against the same standard. BoEs are the documents, artifacts, and processes that demonstrate to external auditors or other interested parties that security and quality exist. Oen, we fall into the trap of thinking that because an application performs a unique function, we should test for different standards. Implementing best practices ensures quality across the product and allows for continual success.

In this chapter, we'll explore how to design and implement effective test strategies within the platform, covering key areas such as development, operations, security, and performance. We'll also learn how to create robust metric strategies that optimize both platform performance and the applications built on it. Additionally, the chapter will cover how to architect recovery strategies that promote resilience and scalability, ensuring the platform can withstand disruptions. Finally, we'll examine how to coordinate incident response operations to enhance reliability and maintain the integrity of both applications and data.

We will cover the following main headings:

- Best practices for testing platforms
- Metrics, monitoring, and performance optimization
- <span id="page-213-6"></span>Platform incident management and recovery

## <span id="page-213-8"></span><span id="page-213-2"></span>Technical requirements

ere are no technical requirements as such. Familiarity with testing options such as Robot Framework and SonarQube may be valuable. Knowledge of metrics integration using tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry (OTel) will also be helpful.

## <span id="page-213-9"></span><span id="page-213-3"></span>Best practices for testing platforms

<span id="page-213-4"></span>roughout soware development, business applications, and even sports, you will hear about the importance of testing to success. Testing allows you to determine whether a planned solution can meet the needed goals and carry out the required strategies. In our basecamp structure, testing occurs primarily in the design, develop, and deploy phases, with opportunities in the operate and support phases as well.

<span id="page-214-1"></span>Each set of testing best practices offers some known areas for success. ese testing practices are aligned roughly with our overall platform vision. Not all testing is internal as some methods may expand to user groups or operational surveys. Practices and metrics may differ slightly across different levels, such as soware development, cloud management, or sales, such as Net Promoter Scores (NPSs). For reference, the NPS is a user experience metric that uses survey questions to ask customers how likely they are to recommend the product. is NPS can be valuable but falls outside the normal testing paradigm. e NPS illustrates how an external practice, gathering user feedback, can contribute to developing internal practices.

<span id="page-214-3"></span>e rst step of any design is writing the test case. Common to DevOps, and essential for Platform Engineering is using test-driven development. Test-driven development means the rst step in achieving success requires developing the test that will demonstrate success. For example, if setting a password policy requiring 8 different characters and no more than 20 characters in total, you would create a test with these parameters rst. e following list claries the elements needed to design and execute successful testing:

- 1. Designing the initial test case: Password must include 8 different characters with no more than 20 characters in total.
- 2. Analyzing the testing requirements: Dene what app framework will be used for the test.
- 3. Setting up a test environment: Establish where testing will occur.
- 4. Analyzing soware or hardware needs within the environment: Ensure the environment has enough capacity for the test.
- 5. Listing criteria for the system to respond: e criteria are at least 8 different characters and no more than 20 characters in total.
- 6. Listing testing methods: List out the methods being used for testing.
- 7. Designing the full test case and subordinate functions: Design the full use case, including elements such as what types of characters are allowed.
- 8. Running tests and studying the results: e results may be as expected or they may show errors or unusual outcomes. An example is a ickering test where different results occur due to time-based system changes that were not part of the testing process.

<span id="page-214-2"></span><span id="page-214-0"></span>One of our favorite testing approaches is Robot Framework. Robot Framework is an open source automation model allowing for test automation. It integrates with numerous tools and libraries. Tests can be established as an initial case and computed against tabular cases, and the results can be measured. Robot Framework elements do not provide a range of answers or alternative solutions, only whether the desired test passes or fails on the criteria. In our password example, any password with fewer than 8 different characters, or more than 20 characters in total, would result in the test failing. Using automation, strings of random elements are created to test these criteria.

Testing should involve checking the initial ow, gathering feedback, and improving outcomes. A key consideration is how well the test environments mirror the production environment. e less difference, the more effective the tests tend to be; if there is more difference, more tests are needed. Automated tests run constantly and help expedite the process. Manual tests take more resources and take longer to identify problems. Do not forget about the impact of Conway's law on testing: if you do not carefully plan, testing will resemble the larger organizational processes and you may not nd the end solution. As an example, testing that veries a streamlined messaging format may miss hierarchical approvals required by the parent organization. e test might be successful, but the outcome skips important steps that affect the nal product. is is a reminder to ensure the delivered functions match expectations through testing. e following sections include some best practices and examples of various tests, beginning with development.

## <span id="page-215-10"></span><span id="page-215-0"></span>Development tests

<span id="page-215-3"></span>Development tests are the most simple and fundamental types of tests. ese tests generally occur without external users, and there is no need for complicated architecture. e key to successful development tests lies in breaking pieces down to their fundamental level and understanding each piece. ink of development testing like preparing to create something in a woodshop: you nd all the components, lay out the correct pieces for assembly, and ask a friend whether the design makes sense. e following list highlights some common development tests:

- <span id="page-215-7"></span><span id="page-215-1"></span>Unit testing (automated): Unit testing assesses the smallest pieces of code that can be logically isolated from another unit. Across multiple languages, this means isolating functions, subroutines, libraries, methods, and properties. Unit testing can look for areas such as correctly used variables, reuse of code segments, and correctly written code.
- <span id="page-215-5"></span>Code quality (partially automated): Agile, DevOps, and XP rely on using code quality checks, starting with paired programmers. Automated systems, especially generative AI, can expand on those code checks. e quality checks are a subjective assessment determining how well the delivered code matches typical code by the team. Tests here seek to isolate the smallest areas to determine reliability, maintainability, testability, portability, reusability, defects, and complexity.
- <span id="page-215-8"></span><span id="page-215-6"></span>Code reviews (largely manual): Direct review of code should be less than 400 lines with an inspection rate of less than 500 lines per hour, never for more than an hour. Good code tests establish a process to x defects, foster a positive code review culture, and practice lightweight reviews. Generative AI, such as GitHub Copilot or OpenAI Codex, can assist by suggesting areas for code improvement. You can employ roles with Large Language Models (LLMs) to frame responses by asking as coder with 20 years of experience, which elements of the tested code can be reduced.
- <span id="page-215-9"></span><span id="page-215-4"></span>Static analysis (automated): Static tests are the automated debugging tests that are carried out before the program runs. is ensures the code is in the right Soware Development Kit (SDK) and analyzed against coding rules. Static testing can discover some early vulnerabilities and bugs through soware such as SonarQube, Veracode, and HP. ese tests eliminate individual security problems, such as open ports and embedded secrets, at the easiest time to x.

<span id="page-215-2"></span>Development tests provide only a portion of the needed information. Once development testing occurs, the completed soware expands to integration test to ensure new features work across the

#### <span id="page-216-3"></span><span id="page-216-0"></span>Integration tests

<span id="page-216-2"></span><span id="page-216-1"></span>Integration practices aim to link feature elements together and bring those individual development code elements into further construction. Some integration can happen early in development, but platform integration focuses on making pieces work individually and then in aggregate with other platform elements. ese tests and practices ensure information can be transmitted across coding elements, that the needed functions are carried out from start to nish, and that you can revert elements without breaking the program. Finally, initial performance tests happen within integration testing, especially to determine whether new code is better or worse at carrying out dened functions.

You should aim to make each integration test automated. Designing for automation within execution allows code to be executed prior to any testing verication. . When the code executes, it should be relatively simple so that a no- or low-code option can be engaged to execute all the integration tests. e test can then provide a complete answer to all potential problems, rather than requiring an individual to constantly execute the tests. Integration tests are also best completed in testing or preproduction environments, showing all processes work effectively before moving on to production. Integration testing best practices are as follows:

- Data testing (automated): Evaluate the information with which the code interacts. Going back to our password example, integration data testing examines whether code can be called from a directory and then veries the code samples against other functions.
- End to end, or E2E (automated): Test the application workows from beginning to end. is integration test checks whether a password is accepted, whether the user has permission to access the right program, and whether they can retrieve or store data within that application. E2E testing is oen combined with data testing for best results.
- Regression (automated): Regression testing requires running functional and non-functional tests aer a change. is practice veries that deployed changes can return to an earlier state when necessary. Regression and reversion are key incident response elements, but only if they work. Regression is also essential when bugs are found and xed.
- Performance (automated): Integration tests are the rst place to examine how well code works. Setting performance tests means looking at memory usage, how long functions require, and which elements of a program are slow, and then establishing comparisons to desired outcomes. Performance tests are run with soware such as Apache JMeter, WebLOAD, and BlazeMeter; however, most are not free. With careful metrics, you can build effective analysis to conduct mostly free performance tests but remember the longer-term performance primarily derives from user experiences.

Soware processes, having been successfully developed and integrated across the platform, can then go through delivery testing. Integration testing involves reviewing the commonalities between elements of the testing and production environments. Delivery testing involves verifying these commonalities.

## <span id="page-217-8"></span><span id="page-217-0"></span>Delivery tests

<span id="page-217-5"></span><span id="page-217-2"></span>Delivery code means a feature is almost ready for prime time but requires one last check. Delivery processes occur at the end of the pipeline, during beta testing, for example, A/B deployments or even canary deployments. ese tests are typically less automated as some parts need to be conducted by distinct user groups separate from developers. User personas can be automated – generative AI can make excellent templates – but there remains no substitute in these tests for actual users. e following list highlights some possible delivery tests:

- Functional (partially automated): Performs input versus output tests in black-box form. During this phase, the code is not tested as individual items but as a set where one input produces exactly one output, and that one output traces to one input. is practice ensures functions are performed correctly.
- Dynamic (partially automated): Dynamic tests seek to nd errors when the code runs. Again, the emphasis on delivery means you do not look for code errors but errors in the function's outputs and inputs. Rather than having set use cases, this option allows for various inputs during execution. ese tests require tight integration with functional testing.
- Red/blue team (blended processes): Red teams are attackers and blue teams are defenders. is test designates a set team to defend a function and one to attack, then compares the results at the end of a cycle. Modern execution sometimes advocates for a purple team as a mix that can perform attack and defense. As a cultural practice, red teams tend to win, so changing the team composition from time to time can be benecial to morale. Hiring an experienced red/blue team can be expensive.
- <span id="page-217-7"></span>Operational testing (manual): Operational tests are also known as user-acceptance tests. ese are where either a single user or a team of users tries to use the new soware. Operational testing is a more formal expression of dynamic tests than beta testing or A/B deployments. e chosen team might be procient in the desired function, or it may consist of new users who receive training at the time. e best output from these tests is careful reports and user stories about the platform's performance. Operational tests may be unnecessary if other tests are performed correctly, but some customers prefer a nal, hands-on acceptance test.

Once delivery tests are complete, only one area remains before users can access fully tested soware as a valuable product.

## <span id="page-217-9"></span><span id="page-217-1"></span>Production tests

<span id="page-217-6"></span>Old-school computer programmers might say production tests are not needed as all aws are caught beforehand. e modern DevOps pace means this no longer holds true. If testing is a reasonable process during development, integration, and delivery, the same quality testing should occur in production. Production tests, especially on the platform, ensure users are not bending parameters into new and untried formations. e following list highlights some common production tests:

- <span id="page-217-4"></span><span id="page-217-3"></span>Runtime security (automated): Runtime security tests are those that run on the actual deployed soware. e key is implementing instrumentation to create observability and telemetry across the system. Runtime implementations check for items not noticed during initial production, such as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) released aer the code reaches deployment. Good runtime testing ensures security aws do not surprise the soware development or operations team.
- Reversion (manual or automated): Similar to regression testing, reversion testing ensures a full rollback can be done on production soware. is ensures that the entire platform can be successfully returned to an earlier state when a bug reaches production. Key

aspects of this test include data integrity, user databases, and minimal downtime. Automated solutions with A/B testing can be set to revert when certain performance metrics are reached automatically.

Integrating tests from delivery to production creates a solid foundation for quality soware. Each step emphasizes different areas, which is only possible as the soware reaches the next step. As a nal best practice, tests should always be run to completion in each section as it is easier to x multiple errors at once, rather than xing them as they occur. If you x an error immediately aer it is identied, there could be subsequent errors aer the initial x. For example, an error in code that prevents compiling must be found before testing in production; without the earlier testing steps, you'll spend longer trying to nd minimal errors. Fixing problems early reduces the amount of time needed to resolve those changes once they reach production. One way to track testing effectiveness is through metrics, monitoring, and performance optimization.

## <span id="page-218-4"></span><span id="page-218-0"></span>Metrics, monitoring, and performance optimization

<span id="page-218-2"></span>Every company wants to deliver more faster, increase customer value, and return a prot to stakeholders. Every DevOps business understands core metrics. More advanced organizations will possess the skill to identify the known unknowns behind the metrics. Gaining initial metrics leads to some understanding but additional details can be derived. Subsequent metrics should be scoped tightly and focused on acceleration and provide clear feedback. is section emphasizes how small changes to achieve some metrics can be deconstructed to provide advanced solutions.

ere is soware that provides metric solutions by managing data across a platform. is soware also allows you to select advanced metrics with multiple comparison levels. Metrics are dened by rst asking some basic questions, which lead to some universal, basic metrics. en, you can formulate more advanced metrics, and nally, convert those numbers into positive actions.

#### <span id="page-218-5"></span><span id="page-218-1"></span>The first questions

<span id="page-218-3"></span>Many oen question why using metrics matters at all, as all individuals in the process understand what is being done and what remains incomplete. Metrics provide a quantiable and repeatable source of observability by measuring multiple processes and driving actionable solutions. e rst element of a metric is a process or action to be measured, such as how many code commits a team makes. ese can be expanded to select daily, weekly, or other time integrations to ensure the best time management. e key to early metric development is to assess the correct time frame to measure something. For example, if you are looking at website traffic to indicate website success, you may want to know whether the traffic hits were within hours aer posting a new promotion or throughout the year.

People might question why a quantiable tracking mechanism is needed, especially in small teams. Most individuals make bad decisions if they do not have quantiable metrics. People who make decisions tend to overestimate their ability to predict correctly. is problem frequently occurs in scheduling tasks; you may predict that a project will take six months but it in fact takes a full year. Human prediction capabilities are so bad that scientists have found that 77% of randomly generated linear models make better decisions than individuals. Examples of decisions include completion times, guilt or innocence, xes required, or proposed solutions. Metrics ensure decisions are less random.

Numbers provide the repeatable component for linear judgments. If we know our development team's performance last week and the week before, then we know that increasing that number by 100% in the following week with no other changes is a bad decision. Another similar decision is buying more cloud space for a projected service increase – thankfully, many of those operational decisions are now handled by load balancers. ese technical load balancers also use metrics; they just make decisions about metrics without human intervention. ese paths lead to options in using generative AI to monitor actions about metrics.

All metrics must spur action. If a metric cannot result in an action, it is not useful. e options we discuss next start with the basics and then expand into options for immediate action. If we return to the earlier commit problem, a basic metric might look at the number of commits per day. Expanding that metric might indicate commits per developer, lines of code per commit, time from the previous commit, or the type of function the commit provided. Each of these could drive a more specic action to resolve changes. You might instruct a slow developer, ask a fast developer to make more complete solutions with more lines, explore context switching between the team, or nd more complicated functions. Each of these metrics then provides a path to make decisions to improve the metric based on organizational goals and value streams. Basic metrics allow for more detailed investigation while advanced metrics point squarely at the problem.

#### <span id="page-219-3"></span><span id="page-219-0"></span>Basic metrics

<span id="page-219-1"></span>Everyone should be familiar with the most basic metrics outlined by the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) organization. ese four metrics, commonly used for soware development, are deployment frequency, mean time to change, mean time to recover, and change failure rate. Let's cover them briey:

- <span id="page-219-2"></span>Deployment frequency: How oen new code is deployed into production. Measured by deployments over time.
- Mean time to change: e time required for a new idea to become production code. Includes deployment frequency measurements. Measured in average time.

- Mean time to recover: e time to recover a production system to stable if bad or unstable code is deployed. Measured in average time.
- Change failure rate: e number of bad code elements that are allowed to reach production. Measured in percentage of bad code elements over good code elements.

<span id="page-220-0"></span>ese initially seem to be excellent metrics but are intended for more mature soware organizations. Starting with these metrics can leave an organization wondering how to improve. For more detailed information, you can [chec](https://dora.dev/)k out the DORA site: https://dora.dev/.

One important area of note among these metrics is that three out of the four are measured in time, with the last measured in percentage. e main point is how each drives additional action. e scope of each element highlights how they are high-level measures of success but are not useful as individual measures or for computing an aggregate score.

All metrics derive from the initial questions: what do you need to know and what happens aerward? is might be about security, production times, or user happiness. It is important to consider whether the metric actually answers the question even when it appears complete. For example, a metric stating that there have been no security breaches might only be tracking known security breaches or dening security breaches within a narrow parameter. While metrics address what seems to be the current need, they should be carefully studied before implementation to ensure real progress.

Measurements guide the development of metrics. e DORA metrics provide a single measurement either of a point in time or across a set period. For those computations to matter, you must also set a desired rate. e metric would drive further action. For example, if the change failure rate is 15%, does that number fall above or below the organization's expected number? In some instances, these SLAs can set rates. Another measurement could be measuring change failure during testing, preproduction, or the actual production environment. In building an effective metric, you might tolerate 15% failure during testing, 3% in pre-production, and less than 1% in actual production.

e other key element depends on deployment numbers within the same period. If a company deploys to production hundreds of times daily, higher failure numbers might be more acceptable as they are likely to be changed by the following deployment. If a team deploys over 100 times per day, each percentage of failure only indicates one piece of deployed code. is raises a common question about the use of raw numbers versus percentages. If a team averages three deployments monthly, the change failure rate would be 0%, 33%, 66%, or 100%. is creates much more variance in how you approach the metrics. In this case, you must directly compare the deployment frequency to the change failure rate for an accurate assessment.

ese discussions can be further complicated when you consider value stream metrics. Some might suggest that value stream metrics should merely echo the DORA metrics. Value streams are derived initially from Lean manufacturing and consider the period from when material enters a process to when you receive value from the customer. DevOps oen considers that deployed code is purchased code, but merely pushing code to production does not always generate revenue. ese considerations should address how many users access production code, or broader operational metrics such as how code affects performance, user happiness, or other factors.

A simple example would be if new code is required for a company promotion event, time to deployment does not matter if the code is not completed before the event. Failure rates do not matter as the event is never launched, delayed, or canceled. Understanding how metrics affect overall value and success is critical to determining the right tests to guarantee development is done correctly and on time.

One question we always receive is how to make sure that your metrics are the right ones. In answering this question, we have found a simple framework from our days in intelligence operations to drive this discussion. e basic model is as follows:

- 1. How do I know what has happened? If requiring a number for measurement, what element must be present to observe or deliver those numbers? For example, is a system reporting uptime computed by server uptime, web availability, or just when the soware is running? Differences in those numbers can require drastically different solutions.
- 2. If I know what has happened, what comes next? If the numbers are accurate, what should the next step be? Should the mean time to change decrease if the deployment frequency is high? If deployment frequency increases while the time to change increases, what action should be taken?
- 3. Are the assumptions true? Were correct assumptions made about the metric? Does the reporting tool assigned deliver the right information at the right frequency to contribute? For example, if the deployment frequency derives from a monthly timeline but the time to change is assessed quarterly, will the relationship between the items still stand?
- <span id="page-221-1"></span>4. Do conclusions follow the assumptions? You should consider whether conclusions about events follow the natural ow of the assumptions. If the conclusion is that value increases because deployment frequency increases, does that hold true if the change failure also increases?
- 5. Compare apples to apples, not oranges to elephants. You must ensure that the items measured are capable of comparison. When measuring deployment frequency, if one team must meet a security standard and the other produces open source, can you compare those rates when selecting improvement actions?

Coming up with answers to these questions for every metric can take some work. We would write them out for every problem when we started using this guideline. Writing out answers addresses questions two, three, and four in providing visual verication for what you are thinking. Writing also addresses the core metric issue that metrics are quantiable and repeatable. Working through a standard process ensures all metrics meet the requirements, avoiding poor metrics in the system. e next section explores using these guidelines to decompose existing metrics to guide actions.

## <span id="page-221-2"></span><span id="page-221-0"></span>Decomposing a metric

<span id="page-222-0"></span>Decomposing any metric requires starting with the current situation. e most important part of decomposition is supporting the shared vision and objectives of the platform. While the metrics needed may be entirely new, chances are that an existing metric lls part of the need. If, by some awful chance, the team does not currently have any metrics, then looking at the SLA can provide guidance on which metrics support operations. If you do not have an SLA, then looking at the acceptance criteria for the functions being built can provide a starting point. ankfully, we now know the basic pillars and levels to guide our foundational construction in building a platform.

Change requires understanding those initial elements. If, for example, we want to explore the stability of our design process, that provides an initial metric. Previous chapters suggested that the design phase should only take up about 10% of the time required for the full value stream. Most teams conduct design during planning events, planned for about 4-8 hours of the 80-hour sprint. is provides an initial assurance that tasks are being completed efficiently. You may want to add to those measurements by determining how long a developer spends on a design once a ticket reaches their workow bucket.

Obtaining additional data for decomposition can occur in multiple ways. You may use surveys to highlight areas that conict with the known process. You can supplement this process with individual interviews or sensing sessions. A sensing session is when one gathers multiple individuals to ask about a particular topic. e key to this qualitative process is using the same questions across multiple interviews. When you use different questions across interviews, you can get a lot of data, but it becomes difficult to compare the individuals' contributions; you are making an oranges to elephants comparison. Between the surveys and interviews, you can oen nd where the existing metric falls short of the data needed to create action. e following list provides a quick look at how you might compose questions to decompose the DORA metric mean time to change:

- How long does it take to complete an action? How is this measured? Do you use story points, stories completed within an epic, the entire epic, or delivery to the customer? Is completed work measured against how much work remains in progress?
- Are constraints identied? e high-level evaluation of average time oen does not show what is slowing down the various areas. Assigning reasons such as lack of time, blocked by other items, or not prioritized can show why the mean time might be changing.
- Who built it? If all tasks are assigned to a team, do we measure change at the team, individual, or product level? Does the metric include complexity as the denominator of time required? For example, can the comparative time between more and less complex tasks be seen? Can you compare the knowledge and skills assigned to the team to the desired output?
- How are different features compared? Where does priority scaling fall into the metric? You want to ensure high-priority items are completed faster than lower-priority items. When comparing different team success rates, are you factoring in the complexity of the problems assigned?
- Never forget about security impacts. Having a fast mean time to change helps, but as earlier, with the change failure rate, does the time to change include later security impacts? You should assess how long is spent in the production pipelines on security, and how that compares to overall production timelines.

<span id="page-223-1"></span>If reading closely, you will see how these decomposition questions mirror the earlier questions about a metric. If a metric is underperforming but the action is unclear, we suggest using a physical or virtual whiteboard to ask the team questions. ese questions help suggest where decomposition is needed to design accurate metrics, create action, and allow the platform to succeed.

## <span id="page-223-3"></span><span id="page-223-0"></span>Monitoring for metrics

<span id="page-223-2"></span>Once you establish metrics, the next step suggests how you might monitor those metrics and provide active alerting. e primary success involves using dashboards to compile different information but create observability. e most important point to consider about dashboards is that they are a starting point for discussion, rather than a nishing point. Many organizations use dashboards to share information but never move past this. Dashboards create a snapshot, a compilation of various data, and some easy alerts in line with needed information. e next step integrates tools such as OTel from the CNCF, building heartbeats or pulse checks, and incorporating metrics into the SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs.

OTel combines tools, APIs, and SDKs into an open source observability framework to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data. Most telemetry data consists of logs, traces, and metrics within the system. e example shown in Figure 9.1 from the OTel documentation demonstrates how OTel may be congured.

![](_page_223_Figure_4.jpeg)

<span id="page-224-1"></span>You can see the various elements within OTel combined with other elements. As an open source option, OTel is one of our favorite tools for designing initial formats. e system instruments code with APIs, gathers SDK data, analyzes data by sampling to reduce errors, provides the required context, exports data, and allows for more ltering with an established backend. One advantage of OTel is exporting ltered data to tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, or Elastic to provide the needed data rapidly. Another common solution for OTel implementation is using the open source Jaeger tools.

<span id="page-224-0"></span>Telemetry solutions can implement quality, time, or application metrics. ese elements look for a push to collect as a heartbeat or a pull to collect as a pulse check. A heartbeat refers to metrics collecting data at a continuous rhythm with constant awareness while a pulse check requires an action to verify that progress continues. An example of the two elements is provided in Figure 9.2 by comparing Prometheus and InuxDB.

![](_page_224_Figure_3.jpeg)

<span id="page-224-2"></span>Figure 9.2: Push and pull with metrics

You can see how Prometheus allows pushing data while InuxDB pull data into the collected format. e difference allows monitoring different elements depending on the compute and storage within the platform. Push metrics can help when contributing to pipelines while the pull metric can be more effective in SSO environments. Applying a push metric solution means every time the pipeline runs in the platform, it pushes data into the metric collection. On the other side, pull data can assess security tools by verifying that user logins are communicated to the larger platform. is pull data supports the observability that all users have authenticated tokens and that API calls are using the latest patches and upgrades.

All combined metric data should be observable through dashboards within the SLA frameworks. Dashboards can show different time frames but allowing monitoring supports implementing comparative decisions. Dashboard design can rapidly scale for different time frames, data, and frameworks. For example, you can set a dashboard to show platform time available, build a Pareto chart demonstrating which apps are available, and then compare through a scaled metric the

individual applications and platform availability. Linking metric types through monitoring allows knowing how to optimize actions and when metrics require a change.

## <span id="page-225-4"></span><span id="page-225-0"></span>Optimizing metrics

<span id="page-225-2"></span>e last element when considering metrics is realizing when a metric is no longer valuable. Teams frequently become attached to their metrics, reporting statistics even when they no longer create value. Metrics are designed to create discussion and inspire action; when a metric no longer achieves that goal, it is time to move on from it. is distinction can be especially difficult when metrics seem positive or were gamied in a way to achieve the metric without creating additional value.

<span id="page-225-3"></span>One great example of a metric that can be gamied occurs in story points for DevOps teams. Story points describe how complex an issue may be, and a potential time for completion. If an issue has two story points, it is twice as complex as an issue with one and may take twice as long. If the metric is how many story points a team completes, some teams may make issues seem more complicated so that they complete a higher number of points. e solution to optimize the metric is rather than using story points, the measurement can be how many of the planned tasks are completed during a sprint. While story points may help team management, the higher percentage of planned versus done tasks allows for more accurate comparison.

Important to optimizing metrics is remembering that no metric should occur in isolation. Each of these metrics can relate to another for improved situational awareness. e math seems straightforward if the desired SLA is less than 1% of bugs released to production, and the metric is the bugs released to production. You should consider the secondary effect that if all code remains held until bug-free, the time to production might increase as every element waits until it is perfect. is summarizes the preceding thought pattern about detailing not just metrics but also the assumptions around those elements.

Metrics are typically posted on dashboards, reviewed during meetings, and cited by employees. Common metrics become cultural frameworks and sometimes express organizational values. A commonly held truth, expressed as a metric, can become a known fact, regardless of other elements surrounding the metric. One friend used to always quote, "50% of the people who quote statistics are right 100% of the time." is type of expression underlies the need to constantly review and update metrics. Optimization best practices require reviewing metrics regularly, not for the information contained but whether the metrics still answer the desired question.

e next section addresses how metrics can be used to inform incident management and recovery.

#### <span id="page-225-5"></span><span id="page-225-1"></span>Platform incident management and recovery

<span id="page-226-0"></span>Platforms are a customer-supporting operation, making incident management and recovery a critical component of success. Incident management should address all potential positive and negative issues, as the main goal remains supporting the customer with a successful platform experience. Normal delivery teams support an incident management response ring aer an event is noticed whether internal or external, and platforms are no different. Previous discussions about tiered support, SREs ensuring various SLAs are met, and security concerns are all important elements of managing platform incidents. Each of those discussions highlighted metrics to further dene how you handle incident resolution over time.

e rst step in any incident process is implementing a ticketing system. ese systems may use soware such as Jira Service Management, ServiceNow, GitLab issues, or even a spreadsheet tracker. e primary concern with selecting ticketing should be the number of issues and the level of observability. If a system receives one to two issues daily, spreadsheets might be practical, but automation becomes essential as that number scales. Automation in incident response ticketing allows rapid triage, assigning resources, and quick resolution for easy problems. A reminder of the tiers has been provided here:

- <span id="page-226-1"></span>Tier 1: Issues resolved through existing documentation and improved practices.
- Tier 2: Issues requiring a change in conguration, such as connections, ports, repositories, or soware versions.
- Tier 3: Issues representing a bug, something that should work but does not, an issue, or a desired new capability.

Some incident notications arise from observability on the system, but others occur through regular reporting. For example, phishing attacks, using a spam email to try and get targets to click links, are oen reported by employees. Aggregating these reports and gaining observability over the ticketing system can reveal where an incident is occurring to a security team.

e platform incident response should use metrics to highlight signicant areas. Metrics are derived from the SLAs and SLIs, depicting effective platform operations. When those metrics slide, the root cause analysis can reveal the need for a broader intervention. Incident response processes typically use some standard process alignment, such as preparation, identication, containment, eradication, lessons learned, and communication. Each step requires a checklist, dedicated to platform operations to resolve incidents.

Essential to incident response is the preparation phase. is preparation constitutes dedicated practices where teams assemble to address simulated issues. A smoothly running incident response requires practice. You never see professional sports athletes commit to a game without practice; the same applies to platform operations. e teams must know who is involved and have a place to practice and a set group of procedures to follow. ese practice sessions should be held at least quarterly and should not be postponed or canceled due to actual events. e temptation is to skip an incident response practice when it occurs shortly aer recovery from an actual incident. While there is no substitute for real-world actions, the practice helps create the success paths for those incidents.

One important point to note about incidents is that the work is not over even aer resolution. e full response is incomplete until all systems recover to the pre-incident operations. In the platform, you will likely have multiple users, with different levels of information, all needing restoration. e 3-2-1 mantra applies here where platform data is backed up on three different media sources, in two physical locations, and with one option located offline. You can regularly test those backups through reversion and regression testing. ese test models help demonstrate success before an operation becomes critical.

Typically, testing is seen as development while incident response activities are operations. In the platform, you can merge these two elements. Tests are key to development, but running tests in operations to verify activity creates observability. Observability then leads to incident awareness, early operations to eliminate problems, and successful recovery. True learning takes place in the DevOps model in creating ow, feedback, and continuous improvement in multiple areas. e next chapter combines all the technical DevOps solutions to provide a structure to create high-performing platform teams.

## <span id="page-227-1"></span><span id="page-227-0"></span>Summary

e platform evaluation in this chapter started with some of the tests and practices you can use to evaluate a platform. Samples of many different tests were introduced, with a path to success. ese tests were then followed by a discussion of metrics. Metrics can be complicated but establishing a metric remains relatively simple. e basic metric framework for any question evaluates how you know and any assumptions around those metrics, and ensures comparisons between metrics are made accurately.

e chapter moved on from those initial metrics to more advanced processes involving decomposing, monitoring, and optimizing metrics for later success. e last step expressed how to set up incident responses within the platform. Incident response includes not just negative outcomes but developing a framework to deal with every potential issue a platform may encounter. Good incident response makes use of effective testing. e next chapter takes those sound technical foundations and expands into how you can build a high-performance platform team.

e boundaries between platforms and applications are rapidly shiing, leading to a future where development environments are increasingly modular, exible, and responsive. is transformation is exemplied by the rise of composable architectures, where platforms are built from interchangeable plug-and-play components. is shi toward modularity allows developers to create and deploy applications with unprecedented speed and precision, perfectly aligning with the dynamic demands of modern markets.

As platforms continue to evolve, they will increasingly blur the lines between infrastructure and soware, creating systems that are not just cohesive but also adaptive. is is particularly evident in the rise of serverless architectures, which abstract the underlying infrastructure entirely, allowing developers to focus solely on application logic. Industry leaders such as AWS Lambda, Microso Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions are already showcasing the potential of serverless technologies to automatically scale applications in response to demand, reducing costs and improving efficiency. ese advancements will drive the development of more sophisticated tools that empower developers to push the boundaries of what's possible, ensuring that their applications meet—and exceed—the expectations of users and markets.

Emerging technologies such as quantum computing, edge computing, and 6G will further accelerate this evolution. ese advancements will enable real-time processing and decision-making at the edge, reducing latency and enhancing user experiences. As platforms become more distributed and intelligent, they will support a wide range of applications, from smart cities to autonomous vehicles, driving transformative change across industries.

As the boundaries between platforms and applications continue to dissolve, the integration of emerging technologies will redene how we develop, manage, and deploy solutions. By embracing these advancements and strategically positioning your organization at the forefront of this evolution, you ensure that your platforms are not only prepared for the future but are also driving innovation and delivering exceptional value. e choices you make today will determine your organization's ability to lead tomorrow—now is the time to act decisively and shape the future.
